please explain following joke "czym się różni betoniarka od mieszalnika pasz? stawką vat"

Różnice w stawce VAT

This joke is a play on the differences in VAT (Value Added Tax) rates in Poland for different types of equipment.  

### **Explanation:**
- "Betoniarka" is a **cement mixer**, used in construction.
- "Mieszalnik pasz" is a **feed mixer**, used in agriculture to mix animal feed.
- "Stawką VAT" means "**by the VAT rate**."

In Poland, agricultural equipment often has a lower VAT rate (e.g., 8%) compared to construction equipment, which is usually taxed at the standard rate (e.g., 23%). 

The humor comes from the fact that these two machines can look very similar and function in a similar way (both mix materials), but their tax classification—and therefore the price—can differ significantly. It’s an ironic take on how bureaucratic tax rules can lead to odd distinctions in seemingly similar products.
