linux/posix mostly compatible, text mode, multiplayer, network, realtime, C language, implementation of the card 'set' game

the source code is lost/missing/unavailable at the moment, will upload if i find missing files; it used to be available at ?~sourceforge.net/tes, however i can't find it anymore.

the game was programmed in ~2002 and tested/played at krak√≥w, studencka 12, august.v-lo.krakow.pl

the bot was spontaneously programmed by an other admin of august.v-lo.krakow.pl
