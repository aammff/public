please explain differences between "teatr jednego widza" "artysta jednego sezonu"

Różnice między idiomami polskimi

Both phrases are Polish idioms, but they refer to different concepts:  

1. **"Teatr jednego widza"** (literally: "theater of one spectator")  
   - This phrase describes a performance, show, or effort directed at a very limited audience—often just one person.  
   - It can be used metaphorically to describe a situation where someone puts in a lot of effort, but only for the benefit of a single person or a very small, possibly uninterested, audience.  
   - It might also imply something overly exclusive, niche, or even pointless due to its lack of reach.  

2. **"Artysta jednego sezonu"** (literally: "artist of one season")  
   - This refers to an artist, performer, or public figure who gains popularity for a short time but quickly fades into obscurity.  
   - It is similar to the English term *one-hit wonder*, but it is broader—it can apply not only to musicians but also to actors, writers, or other creative individuals whose success lasts only a season or a short period.  
   - It often carries a slightly dismissive tone, implying that the person didn’t have lasting talent or impact.  

So, while **"teatr jednego widza"** focuses on the limited audience of an effort, **"artysta jednego sezonu"** is about short-lived success.
