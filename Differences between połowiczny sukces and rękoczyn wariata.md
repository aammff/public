1. **Połowiczny sukces**:
   - **Literal meaning**: "Half success" or "partial success."
   - **Usage**: This phrase refers to a situation where only part of a goal or objective has been achieved. It implies that while there is some progress or achievement, the outcome is incomplete or not fully satisfactory.
   - **Example**: If someone sets out to complete a project but only finishes half of it, they might describe it as a "połowiczny sukces."

2. **Rękoczyn wariata**:
   - **Literal meaning**: "The act of a madman" or "a madman's deed."
   - **Usage**: This phrase describes an action that is reckless, irrational, or seemingly insane. It often implies that the action is unpredictable, dangerous, or foolish, as if performed by someone who is not in their right mind.
   - **Example**: If someone makes a highly risky or nonsensical decision, others might refer to it as a "rękoczyn wariata."

### Key Differences:
