please explain differences between tetris tetrisbsd tetr.io blockout

Hereâ€™s an explanation of the differences between **Tetris**, **TetrisBSD**, **TETR.IO**, and **Blockout**:

---

### **Tetris**
- **Original Game**: Tetris was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. It is a tile-matching puzzle game where players arrange falling tetrominoes to complete horizontal lines, which then disappear.
- **Mechanics**: The gameplay involves rotating and moving tetrominoes as they fall into a grid, aiming to clear lines for points.
- **Visuals and Rules**: The original game has a simple grid-based interface with basic rotation mechanics, and the "rules" (e.g., scoring, speeds, etc.) vary slightly across versions.
- **Legacy**: It has many official and unofficial adaptations on various platforms, making it one of the most recognized video games.

### **TetrisBSD**
- **Unix/Linux Version**: TetrisBSD is a text-based version of Tetris that runs on Unix-like systems, often in a terminal window.
- **Visual Style**: It uses ASCII art or terminal-based rendering for gameplay.
- **Purpose**: Often a fun addition for developers or Unix enthusiasts, offering a nostalgic, minimalist experience.
- **Gameplay Features**: Maintains the original gameplay mechanics but adapted for the terminal. It is simple and barebones compared to modern versions.

### **TETR.IO**
- **Modern Multiplayer Tetris**: TETR.IO is a community-driven, competitive, and customizable multiplayer Tetris game. It is influenced by modern Tetris guidelines.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Online Multiplayer**: Includes matchmaking, ranking systems, and casual rooms.
  - **Customization**: Players can create custom skins, modify settings, and adjust the gameplay.
  - **Modern Mechanics**: Implements mechanics like SRS (Super Rotation System), hold pieces, and T-spins, which are standard in competitive Tetris games.
  - **Competitive Scene**: Designed for fast-paced gameplay, emphasizing strategy and reflexes.
- **Platform**: Browser-based and standalone desktop application.
- **Community**: Includes leaderboards, events, and a focus on competitive play.

### **Blockout**
- **3D Variant of Tetris**: Blockout takes the basic concept of Tetris and expands it into 3D.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**:
  - Instead of a 2D grid, players drop pieces into a 3D well.
  - The pieces can be rotated along three axes (X, Y, Z), adding complexity.
  - The objective is to fill entire layers (not just lines) to clear them.
- **Challenge**: The 3D space requires spatial awareness and makes it significantly harder than traditional Tetris.
- **Legacy**: Blockout has inspired various clones and is notable for pioneering 3D puzzle gameplay.
