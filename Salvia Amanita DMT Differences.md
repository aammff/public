please explain differences between salvia amanita dmt changa

The substances **Salvia divinorum**, **Amanita muscaria**, and **DMT (changa)** are all psychoactive, but they differ significantly in their chemical composition, effects, cultural usage, and mechanisms of action. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Salvia Divinorum**
- **Active Compound**: Salvinorin A.
- **Mechanism of Action**: Salvinorin A is a kappa-opioid receptor agonist. It is unique because it does not interact with serotonin receptors like most other psychedelics.
- **Effects**:
  - Extremely potent and fast-acting, with effects lasting 5–20 minutes when smoked or vaporized.
  - Can cause intense hallucinations, loss of physical control, and a sense of detachment from reality.
  - Users often report experiences such as merging with objects, time distortion, or entering "alternate dimensions."
- **Legal Status**: Restricted or banned in many places.
- **Traditional Use**: Historically used by the Mazatec people of Mexico for divination and healing.
- **Risks**: Due to its potency, it can cause confusion, fear, or psychological discomfort.

### **2. Amanita Muscaria (Fly Agaric Mushroom)**
- **Active Compounds**: Ibotenic acid and muscimol.
- **Mechanism of Action**:
  - Ibotenic acid is an NMDA receptor agonist, while muscimol primarily works on GABA receptors.
  - This creates effects unlike those of traditional psychedelics, which target serotonin receptors.
- **Effects**:
  - Sedation, altered perception, euphoria, and vivid dreams.
  - High doses can lead to hallucinations, delusions, and physical symptoms like nausea.
- **Legal Status**: Legal in most countries as it is not classified as a controlled substance.
- **Traditional Use**: Used in shamanic practices in Siberia and Northern Europe.
- **Risks**: Can be toxic in high doses, causing convulsions or coma. Proper preparation (e.g., drying) reduces toxicity.

### **3. DMT (Changa)**
- **Active Compound**: N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) infused into a smokable blend of herbs, often with an added MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) like harmala alkaloids.
- **Mechanism of Action**: DMT is a serotonin receptor agonist, specifically targeting the 5-HT2A receptor, which is typical for classic psychedelics.
- **Effects**:
  - Rapid onset and short duration (10–20 minutes for changa).
  - Intense visual and auditory hallucinations, euphoria, and the sensation of entering another "realm" or interacting with "entities."
- **Legal Status**: Illegal in many countries as DMT is a Schedule I drug in the U.S. and similar classifications exist elsewhere.
- **Traditional Use**: DMT is a key ingredient in ayahuasca, used in South American shamanic ceremonies.
- **Risks**: Psychological challenges include overwhelming experiences or "bad trips."
