please help alice bob and carol decide on which game to play: starcraft or three-player chess

Alice, Bob, and Carol can use a decision-making approach to choose between **StarCraft** and **Three-Player Chess**. Here's a framework to help them decide:

---

### 1. **Criteria for Decision**
   Each person should consider:
   - **Preference:** Which game they enjoy more.
   - **Skill Level:** How comfortable they are with each game.
   - **Game Type:** Real-time strategy (StarCraft) vs. turn-based strategy (Chess).
   - **Duration:** StarCraft can last 30-60 minutes, while Three-Player Chess games might vary.
   - **Equipment Needs:** Ensure everyone has the required setup (e.g., computers for StarCraft).

---

### 2. **Group Consensus**
   **Vote Method:** Each person ranks the games from 1 (preferred) to 2 (less preferred).
   - If there’s a tie, consider playing one today and the other next time.
   - Use a weighted decision by considering each person’s enthusiasm.

### 3. **Quick Poll**
Ask:
1. Do you prefer **collaborative gaming** (like StarCraft in teams) or **competitive gaming** (Chess)?
2. How familiar are you with each game?  
3. Are you in the mood for a **fast-paced game** (StarCraft) or a **deliberate, strategic game** (Chess)?

---

### 4. **Randomizer (if undecided)**
If the group is split evenly:
- Flip a coin or use an online randomizer to pick.
