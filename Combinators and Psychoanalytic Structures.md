Combinators and Psychoanalytic Structures

You're drawing an interesting web of connections across logic, computation, structural proof theory, and psychoanalytic thought. Let’s explore possible correspondences between these concepts:

### 1. **S and K Combinators (Combinatory Logic)**  
   - The **S** and **K** combinators are the foundation of combinatory logic, which eliminates variables from expressions.
   - **K (Kx y → x)** represents a kind of **weakening**, discarding the second argument.
   - **S (Sx y z → x z (y z))** is a form of substitution and duplication, enabling interactions that resemble **contraction**.

### 2. **Contraction & Weakening (Structural Rules in Proof Theory)**  
   - In sequent calculus, **weakening** allows adding unused assumptions (akin to K).  
   - **Contraction** allows duplicating assumptions, which echoes the behavior of S in how it redistributes terms.

### 3. **Obsession and Hysteria (Psychoanalysis, Lacan, Freud)**  
   - In psychoanalytic theory, **obsession** involves repetition, control, and preservation of a structure (linked to contraction, since contraction keeps things "the same").
   - **Hysteria**, on the other hand, involves a certain kind of excess and shifting identifications, which might be compared to weakening (introducing "extra" elements or allowing for more flexibility).
   - If we interpret structural rules in a psychoanalytic light, **obsession** corresponds to **contraction** (repeating and maintaining strict identity), while **hysteria** corresponds to **weakening** (allowing for substitution, loss, or displacement).

### 4. **Bridging These Ideas**  
   - The **S combinator**'s duplicative nature resonates with **contraction**, making it structurally obsessive.  
   - The **K combinator**'s tendency to discard arguments parallels **weakening**, which aligns with the looseness of hysteria.  
   - Combinatory logic eliminates explicit variable bindings, removing a layer of structure—perhaps an "hysterical" move against traditional term-based logic.

### 5. **Possible Further Connections**  
   - The **Lambek calculus** (which removes weakening and contraction) is used in categorial grammar, which has implications for how obsessional and hysterical speech forms structure themselves.
   - In **Girard’s linear logic**, the absence of contraction and weakening enforces a kind of "strict economy," possibly mirroring a psychodynamic tension between excessive control (obsession) and fluid identity shifts (hysteria).
