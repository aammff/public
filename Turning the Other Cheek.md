please interpret other cheek

Turning the Other Cheek

"Other cheek" usually refers to the phrase *"turn the other cheek,"* which comes from the Bible (Matthew 5:39). It means responding to aggression, insults, or wrongdoing with patience and forgiveness instead of retaliation. The idea is often associated with nonviolence, humility, and moral strength.  

Context can change the meaning, though. Are you referring to it in a specific situation?
