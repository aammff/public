please explain the following joke: "jak się nazywa osoba, która nie potrafi czytać i pisać programów komputerowyc? analfabeta"


This joke plays on the similarity between two different meanings of the word "analfabeta," which in Polish means "illiterate" — someone who cannot read or write.

The joke asks: "What do you call a person who cannot read and write computer programs?" and answers with "analfabeta." Normally, "analfabeta" refers to someone who is unable to read or write in general. But here, the joke twists the meaning by applying it to computer programming, implying that someone who can't code is essentially "illiterate" in the world of technology.

The humor comes from treating the inability to write computer code as an equivalent of being illiterate in a traditional sense.
