[Porównanie tekstów filozoficznych]

The comparison of *SN 35.63 Migajāla Sutta: To Migajāla* from the Pāli Buddhist canon to "Garby," a story from Leszek Kołakowski's *13 bajek z królestwa Lailonii dla dużych i małych* (13 Tales from the Kingdom of Lailonia for Big and Small), involves exploring their underlying philosophical ideas, themes, and literary styles.

### **1. SN 35.63 Migajāla Sutta**
- **Theme and Philosophy**: The sutta addresses the nature of attachment and liberation. Migajāla is taught about the distinction between being "alone" and "living with others." The Buddha explains that true solitude is not merely physical but mental; it is achieved by being free from attachment to sensory experiences and perceptions. This teaching focuses on the mind's entanglement with craving and its role in perpetuating suffering.
- **Message**: The Sutta promotes detachment as a path to liberation, highlighting the impermanence of sensory experiences and the importance of cultivating mindfulness and insight.
- **Style**: The language is straightforward and didactic, aimed at conveying profound truths succinctly for a spiritual audience.

### **2. "Garby" by Leszek Kołakowski**
- **Theme and Philosophy**: "Garby" is a philosophical allegory exploring societal norms, individual identity, and the absurdity of rigidly following conventions. The story, like others in the collection, uses the whimsical and fantastical setting of Lailonia to pose existential questions and challenge readers' assumptions about life, meaning, and freedom.
- **Message**: Through humor and absurdity, Kołakowski critiques social constructs and suggests that blind adherence to tradition can lead to alienation and loss of individuality.
- **Style**: The narrative is playful, imaginative, and rich with irony. It uses storytelling to provoke philosophical reflection in a more indirect, accessible manner.

   - Both works delve into profound questions of human existence: the Sutta focuses on overcoming suffering through mental discipline, while "Garby" examines freedom and the constraints of societal norms.

2. **Method of Communication**:
   - The Sutta employs direct teaching and prescriptive guidance, suitable for a religious and philosophical audience seeking practical wisdom.
   - "Garby" uses allegory and satire, engaging the reader with imaginative storytelling while prompting introspection about modern life and values.

3. **View of Freedom**:
   - In the Sutta, freedom is liberation from attachment and craving, achieved through spiritual practice.
   - In "Garby," freedom involves questioning societal norms and asserting individuality, framed through a more existential and social lens.

4. **Tone and Audience**:
   - The Sutta's tone is serious, reflective, and instructive, targeting those on a spiritual path.
   - "Garby" adopts a lighthearted, ironic tone, making philosophical ideas accessible to a broader audience, including children and adults.

### **Convergence and Divergence**
- **Convergence**: Both texts seek to liberate individuals, albeit in different contexts—spiritual (the Sutta) versus societal and existential (Kołakowski).
- **Divergence**: The Sutta emphasizes inner detachment from sensory inputs as the path to freedom, while "Garby" underscores the need to challenge external structures and conventions to achieve authentic living.
