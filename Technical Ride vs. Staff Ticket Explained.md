Technical Ride vs. Staff Ticket Explained

In Polish, **"przejazd techniczny"** and **"bilet techniczny"** are terms related to transportation, but they refer to different concepts:

### 1. **Przejazd techniczny**  
   - **Meaning**: A **"technical ride"** or **"non-revenue trip"** (e.g., in public transport or railways).  
   - **Purpose**:  
     - Used when a vehicle (train, tram, bus) moves without passengers, typically for operational reasons (e.g., repositioning, maintenance transfers, or empty runs between depots).  
     - Not intended for regular passenger service.  
   - **Example**: A train going from a depot to a station where it starts its scheduled route.  

### 2. **Bilet techniczny**  
   - **Meaning**: A **"technical ticket"** or **"staff ticket"**.  
   - **Purpose**:  
     - Issued for railway/passenger transport employees or authorized personnel for work-related travel (not for regular passengers).  
     - Sometimes used for testing or inspection purposes (e.g., a controller checking ticket validation systems).  
     - May also refer to a free or discounted ticket for transport staff.  
   - **Example**: A railway worker using a "bilet techniczny" to travel between stations for duty.  

### **Key Difference**:  
- **"Przejazd techniczny"** refers to the **movement of the vehicle itself** (without passengers).  
- **"Bilet techniczny"** refers to a **special ticket for staff or operational use**.
