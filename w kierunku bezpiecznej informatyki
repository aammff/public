no gc / gc-less [gc-dependent code is useless for rt systems, avoid time-based algorithmic hazard]

no self-hosted-compilers or their outputs [please stop spread of semantic viruses]

prefer languages with formal semantics [no wild language experiments on people ;-)]

no patents, no ip, etc [don't lie, you haven't invented anything by youself]
