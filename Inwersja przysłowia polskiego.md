please find inverse statement "mądrej głowie dość dwie słowie"

Inwersja przysłowia polskiego

The inverse (or opposite) of the Polish proverb **"Mądrej głowie dość dwie słowie"** (which roughly means "A wise head needs only a few words"—suggesting that smart people understand quickly and don’t need long explanations) could be something like:  

**"Głupiemu i tysiąc słów nie wystarczy."**  
(“Even a thousand words are not enough for a fool.”)  

Would you like a more creative twist on it? 😊
