please explain differences between "półć" "pułć" "płeć"

Różnice między słowami polskimi

It looks like you're asking about Polish words, but "półć" and "pułć" are not standard Polish words. The correct word "płeć" is a commonly used Polish word. Here's an explanation:

1. **Płeć** – This is a real Polish word meaning **"sex" or "gender"** (biological or social classification of male and female).  
   - Example: *Jaka jest twoja płeć?* (What is your gender?)

2. **Półć** – This is not a standard Polish word. It looks like a combination of *pół* ("half") and something else, but it is not used in modern Polish.

3. **Pułć** – This also does not appear to be a correct Polish word. It might be a typo or a rare dialectal word.

If you meant something specific with *półć* or *pułć*, let me know, and I can help clarify!
