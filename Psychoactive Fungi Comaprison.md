please explain differences between "Claviceps purpurea" "Amanita muscaria" "Psilocybe cubensis" "Psilocybe semilanceata"

Here’s a breakdown of the differences among **Claviceps purpurea**, **Amanita muscaria**, **Psilocybe cubensis**, and **Psilocybe semilanceata**, focusing on taxonomy, biology, effects, and uses:

---

### **1. Claviceps purpurea**  
- **Classification**: Fungus (phylum: Ascomycota)  
- **Appearance**: Grows as sclerotia (hard, dark fungal structures) on rye and other cereals.  
- **Habitat**: Parasitic on grasses, especially rye.  
- **Active Compounds**: Produces ergot alkaloids (e.g., ergotamine).  
- **Effects**:  
  - Causes **ergotism** if ingested in contaminated grains: symptoms include vasoconstriction, gangrene, convulsions, and hallucinations.  
  - Precursor for synthesizing LSD.  
- **Use**: Historically used in medicine for inducing labor and treating migraines (ergot derivatives).  
- **Toxicity**: Highly toxic if consumed.

### **2. Amanita muscaria**  
- **Classification**: Fungus (phylum: Basidiomycota)  
- **Appearance**: Iconic red cap with white spots; white gills and stem.  
- **Habitat**: Mycorrhizal with trees, commonly found in temperate and boreal forests.  
- **Active Compounds**: Ibotenic acid and muscimol.  
- **Effects**:  
  - Psychoactive and hallucinogenic.  
  - Symptoms include altered perception, delirium, and euphoria, but also nausea and physical discomfort.  
- **Use**: Traditional shamanic and spiritual rituals in Siberian cultures; recreationally for altered states of consciousness.  
- **Toxicity**: Less toxic than other Amanita species (like *A. phalloides*), but can cause poisoning.

### **3. Psilocybe cubensis**  
- **Classification**: Fungus (phylum: Basidiomycota)  
- **Appearance**: Medium-sized mushrooms with golden-brown caps and whitish stems, often bruising blue.  
- **Habitat**: Grows on dung in tropical and subtropical regions.  
- **Active Compounds**: Psilocybin and psilocin.  
- **Effects**:  
  - Profoundly psychedelic, causing altered perception, euphoria, and introspection.  
  - Effects last 4–6 hours.  
- **Use**: Recreational, therapeutic (for mental health issues like depression and PTSD).  
- **Toxicity**: Low toxicity; minimal physical harm when used responsibly.

### **4. Psilocybe semilanceata**  
- **Classification**: Fungus (phylum: Basidiomycota)  
- **Appearance**: Small, conical caps (liberty cap) with thin stems, often bruising blue.  
- **Habitat**: Found in grasslands, often in moist, temperate regions.  
- **Active Compounds**: Psilocybin and psilocin.  
- **Effects**:  
  - Similar to *P. cubensis*, but generally considered more potent per weight.  
- **Use**: Psychedelic purposes, including recreational and ceremonial use.  
- **Toxicity**: Low; considered safe when used responsibly.
