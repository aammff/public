RÃ³Å¼nice miÄ™dzy przejazdem a biletem

Sure! The terms **"przejazd techniczny"** and **"bilet techniczny"** are used in the context of public transport or railways in Poland, and while they sound similar, they refer to different things:

---

### **1. Przejazd techniczny**  
**Literal meaning:** *technical ride / technical run*

**What it is:**  
A **przejazd techniczny** is a non-passenger service ride â€” usually when a train, tram, or bus moves **without passengers** for operational reasons. It might be:

- A vehicle going to or from a depot,
- A repositioning ride (e.g. to start its route elsewhere),
- A test run (after maintenance, or for training purposes),
- A maintenance or inspection ride.

**Key point:** No passengers are allowed onboard, itâ€™s purely operational.

### **2. Bilet techniczny**  
**Literal meaning:** *technical ticket*

**What it is:**  
A **bilet techniczny** is a **special type of internal-use or placeholder ticket**, used for:

- Accounting or system reasons â€” e.g., when a conductor needs to issue a "zero fare" ticket,
- Special permissions (e.g., for staff, inspectors, or special transport cases),
- In some systems, it's used for **manual overrides** or **non-standard travel situations** (e.g., ticket machines or systems needing a placeholder ticket entry for technical purposes).

**Key point:** It's not usually sold to regular passengers, but used internally or for special cases.
