please summarize in the table the proper matching between each of the 20 + 32 = 52 human teeth and a set of 52 playing cards


To match the 52 human teeth (20 primary + 32 permanent) with a deck of 52 playing cards, let's consider the following approach:

1. **Divide the Deck by Tooth Type**:
   - **20 Primary Teeth**: Match with one set of 20 cards, such as Hearts and Diamonds from 2 to 10 (since face cards are often used for permanent teeth).
   - **32 Permanent Teeth**: Match with the remaining 32 cards, potentially using face cards for specific notable teeth (e.g., molars).

2. **Assign Each Suit to a Quadrant**:
   - Divide the mouth into four quadrants, each associated with a suit:
     - **Upper Right Quadrant**: Spades
     - **Upper Left Quadrant**: Hearts
     - **Lower Right Quadrant**: Clubs
     - **Lower Left Quadrant**: Diamonds

3. **Assign Each Card to a Tooth**:
   - **Primary Teeth (Hearts and Diamonds 2–10)**: Assign Hearts to the upper left and Diamonds to the lower left quadrants.
   - **Permanent Teeth (All Suits)**: Use all four suits to fill out 32 positions for adult teeth, with special focus on face cards for molars.

| **Tooth Type**         | **Quadrant**          | **Suit**       | **Tooth Range**           | **Card Range**  |
|------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Primary (20)**       | Upper Left            | Hearts        | 5 teeth (A–E)             | 2–10 Hearts     |
|                        | Lower Left            | Diamonds      | 5 teeth (A–E)             | 2–10 Diamonds   |
|                        | Upper Right           | Clubs         | 5 teeth (A–E)             | 2–10 Clubs      |
|                        | Lower Right           | Spades        | 5 teeth (A–E)             | 2–10 Spades     |
| **Permanent (32)**     | Upper Left            | Hearts        | 8 teeth                   | J–A Hearts      |
|                        | Lower Left            | Diamonds      | 8 teeth                   | J–A Diamonds    |
|                        | Upper Right           | Clubs         | 8 teeth                   | J–A Clubs       |
|                        | Lower Right           | Spades        | 8 teeth                   | J–A Spades      |

In this setup:
- **Primary Teeth** are represented by numbers 2–10 in Hearts and Diamonds for the left side, Clubs and Spades for the right side.
- **Permanent Teeth** are represented by J–A in all suits across four quadrants. 

Each tooth has a unique corresponding card, facilitating memorization by quadrant and suit.
