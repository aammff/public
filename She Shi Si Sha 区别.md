- **Meaning:** Each syllable (with tone) has unique meanings or associations in Mandarin.

To master these differences, focus on:
1. Practicing tones using minimal pairs (e.g., shī vs. shí).
2. Listening to native speakers and mimicking their pronunciation.
3. Using the words in context to reinforce their meanings.
