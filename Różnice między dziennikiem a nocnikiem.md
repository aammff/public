please explain differences between dziennik and nocnik

[Różnice między dziennikiem a nocnikiem]

"Dziennik" and "nocnik" are two distinct Polish words, and they refer to completely different things:

1. **Dziennik**:
   - **Meaning**: "Dziennik" translates to "diary" or "journal" in English. It typically refers to a written record of daily events, thoughts, or experiences. It can also be used in the context of newspapers, as "dziennik" is sometimes a term for a daily newspaper.
   - **Usage**: 
     - As a personal diary: *Piszę w dzienniku* (I am writing in my diary).
     - As a daily newspaper: *Czytałem dziennik rano* (I read the newspaper in the morning).

2. **Nocnik**:
   - **Meaning**: "Nocnik" is a "chamber pot" or "bedpan" in English. It refers to a small container used for relieving oneself, typically used by young children or people who cannot get to a toilet. It can also refer to a portable toilet used at night, hence the name "nocnik" (related to "noc" meaning night).
   - **Usage**: 
     - Referring to a child's potty: *Mój syn używa nocnika* (My son uses a potty).
     - Referring to an adult’s chamber pot: *Przynieś nocnik* (Bring the chamber pot).

In summary:
- **Dziennik** = a diary or journal, or a daily newspaper.
- **Nocnik** = a chamber pot or potty used for relieving oneself, typically in a domestic setting.

They are completely unrelated both in meaning and usage.
