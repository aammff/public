RLE Algorithm Comparison Haskell Prolog

Hereâ€™s a comparison of Run-Length Encoding (RLE) implementations in **Haskell** and **Prolog**:

---

## **Haskell Implementation**
```haskell
encode :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [(a, Int)]
encode [] = []
encode (x:xs) = (x, length (takeWhile (==x) (x:xs))) : encode (dropWhile (==x) xs)
```

### **Explanation:**
- Uses **pattern matching** to handle empty lists.
- Groups consecutive identical elements using `takeWhile` and counts them.
- Recursively processes the remaining elements using `dropWhile`.
- Uses **immutable data structures** (lists) and **lazy evaluation** for efficiency.

### **Pros:**
âœ” Very concise and declarative.  
âœ” Uses built-in higher-order functions.  
âœ” Efficient in a functional programming style.  

### **Cons:**
âœ˜ Can be inefficient for very large lists due to multiple traversals (`takeWhile` & `dropWhile`).  
âœ˜ Not tail-recursive (causes stack growth for large inputs).  

---

## **Prolog Implementation**
```prolog
encode([], []).
encode([X|Xs], Encoded) :-
    count_occurrences(X, Xs, Rest, Count),
    encode(Rest, EncodedRest),
    Encoded = [(X, Count) | EncodedRest].

count_occurrences(X, [X|Xs], Rest, Count) :-
    count_occurrences(X, Xs, Rest, Count1),
    Count is Count1 + 1.
count_occurrences(X, [Y|Ys], [Y|Ys], 1) :- X \= Y.
count_occurrences(X, [], [], 1).
```

### **Explanation:**
- Uses **recursion** to count occurrences of consecutive elements.
- `count_occurrences/4` counts occurrences of the first element and returns the rest of the list.
- Calls `encode/2` recursively on the remainder.
- Uses **pattern matching** and **unification** for list traversal.

### **Pros:**
âœ” Uses logical programming paradigms (declarative).  
âœ” Works well with Prologâ€™s **backtracking** and **pattern matching**.  

### **Cons:**
âœ˜ Less readable than Haskellâ€™s version.  
âœ˜ Requires an extra helper predicate (`count_occurrences/4`).  
âœ˜ Prologâ€™s recursion handling might be less efficient in some cases.

## **Key Differences**
| Feature          | Haskell | Prolog |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| **Paradigm**    | Functional | Logic-based |
| **Conciseness** | More concise (one function) | Requires helper predicate |
| **Efficiency**  | Lazy evaluation helps | Recursion can be costly |
| **Ease of Understanding** | Easier due to high-level abstractions | More complex due to unification and recursion |

### **Conclusion**
- **Haskellâ€™s implementation** is more **concise and expressive** due to higher-order functions and lazy evaluation.
- **Prologâ€™s implementation** is more **explicit and logical**, aligning with the **rule-based nature** of the language.
