Level Designer vs Mini-Game

A **level designer** and a **mini-game** are related to game development but serve different purposes. Hereâ€™s how they differ:

### **Level Designer**
- A **level designer** is a game developer responsible for creating levels, maps, or environments within a game.
- They focus on **gameplay flow**, **pacing**, **player progression**, and **object placement** (such as enemies, obstacles, or rewards).
- Level designers work within the main game structure and collaborate with artists, programmers, and game designers.
- Example: In a platformer game, a level designer might create a stage with moving platforms, enemy placements, and puzzle elements.

### **Mini-Game**
- A **mini-game** is a smaller, self-contained game within a larger game.
- Mini-games often provide a break from the main gameplay and can introduce different mechanics.
- They may be used for rewards, side content, or story elements.
- Example: The **"Triple Triad"** card game in *Final Fantasy VIII* or the **"Five Finger Fillet"** knife game in *Red Dead Redemption*.

### **Key Differences**
