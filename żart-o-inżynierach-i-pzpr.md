This joke plays on dark humor and references historical and political contexts in Poland. Let’s break it down step by step:

    "Kto zbudował obozy koncentracyjne? inż budownictwa"
    Translation: "Who built the concentration camps? Civil engineers."
    The joke begins by asking a serious question with a shocking answer. Concentration camps, particularly during WWII, were constructed by the Nazi regime, and civil engineers were involved in their planning and building. The humor comes from the absurdity of giving a simple, technical answer to a deeply tragic and morally loaded question.

    "Kto mnie zgwałcił? inż budownictwa"
    Translation: "Who raped me? Civil engineers."
    This escalates the absurdity, as it applies the same technical profession (civil engineers) to another serious and traumatic event, which further amplifies the shock value of the joke.

    "A czym się różni? ten drugi należał do pzpr a ten pierwszy nie"
    Translation: "What's the difference? The second one belonged to the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), the first one didn’t."
    This punchline introduces a political twist. The joke implies that the second engineer, the one responsible for the rape, was a member of the PZPR, the Communist party that ruled Poland after WWII until 1989. The first engineer, responsible for building the concentration camps, was not. This juxtaposition humorously and darkly implies that being a member of the PZPR somehow makes the second crime (rape) worse or notable in some ironic way.

Context:

    Concentration camps were built during WWII by the Nazis, and many Poles suffered under both Nazi occupation and the post-war Communist regime.
    PZPR (Polish United Workers' Party) was the Communist party that controlled Poland for much of the 20th century, and it’s often associated with corruption, abuses of power, and repression. By linking one of the perpetrators to this party, the joke is playing on the disillusionment many Poles felt toward the regime.

Tone:

The humor here is dark and politically charged, relying on absurdity, historical references, and cynicism about the Communist era in Poland.
