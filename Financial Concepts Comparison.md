[Financial Concepts Comparison]

These terms each describe different relationships, obligations, and concepts, often in financial, moral, or philosophical contexts. Here's a breakdown:

---

### **1. Bread of Shame**
- **Origin:** The concept comes from Kabbalistic and mystical Jewish thought.
- **Meaning:** It refers to the discomfort or embarrassment one feels when receiving something unearned, such as charity or a gift that lacks reciprocity. The idea emphasizes the human desire to earn and deserve blessings or rewards to avoid the psychological discomfort of dependency or unworthiness.
- **Key Idea:** Human fulfillment often comes from effort and earning, not merely receiving. This principle is applied in spiritual and moral teachings about work, dignity, and reciprocity.

---

### **2. Gift**
- **Definition:** A gift is something voluntarily given without expectation of return or compensation.
- **Characteristics:**
  - No repayment or obligation is tied to it.
  - It is given out of generosity, affection, or goodwill.
  - Gifts can be tangible (like a present) or intangible (like time or advice).
- **Key Distinction:** A true gift is unconditional, though social norms sometimes imply informal reciprocity.

---

### **3. Loan**
- **Definition:** A loan is an arrangement where one party (the lender) gives something (typically money) to another (the borrower) with the expectation that it will be returned, often with interest.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Legally binding.
  - Usually accompanied by terms of repayment and interest.
  - Creates a debtor-creditor relationship.
- **Key Distinction:** Loans explicitly involve an obligation to return the principal (and often more).

---

### **4. Bond**
- **Definition:** A bond is a formal contract to repay borrowed money with interest at fixed intervals.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Common in finance and investment.
  - Issued by entities like governments or corporations to raise capital.
  - Includes details of repayment (maturity date, interest rate).
- **Key Distinction:** Bonds are a type of loan but are standardized, tradable financial instruments with a fixed structure.

---

### **5. Promissory Note**
- **Definition:** A promissory note is a written promise to pay a specified amount of money to a designated party at a specific time or on demand.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Legally binding document.
  - Less formal than a loan agreement but more formal than a verbal promise.
  - Often used in personal or business transactions (e.g., IOUs).
- **Key Distinction:** Unlike bonds, promissory notes are not usually tradable and are often used for smaller, non-public transactions.
