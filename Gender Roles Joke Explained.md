Gender Roles Joke Explained

This joke plays on societal stereotypes and expectations about gender roles. Here's a breakdown:

1. **"What is a woman? Writing on doll's box."**  
   This refers to how traditional toys marketed to girls, like dolls, often come with specific themes or purposes clearly labeled on the box. These might include nurturing roles (e.g., "Mommy Doll," "Babysitter Barbie") or stereotypically "feminine" traits, like beauty and care. It humorously suggests that society has predefined and easily identifiable roles or expectations for women.

2. **"What is a man? Don't ask."**  
   This line implies that defining what a man is might be more complicated or controversial. It can reflect:
   - The societal ambiguity or lack of consensus on what it means to "be a man."
   - The avoidance of confronting rigid or toxic masculinity norms.
   - A humorous jab at the idea that men aren't as easily categorized or that there isn't a simple label like there is for dolls.

The humor comes from the contrast: women are humorously "reduced" to something easily defined (albeit stereotypically), while men are jokingly left undefined, either due to complexity, societal discomfort, or reluctance to stereotype.
