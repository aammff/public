CPU ID and Batch Number

Yes, a CPU should have both an **ID (serial number)** and, in most cases, a **batch number** embedded or attached. These identifiers serve different purposes:  

1. **CPU ID (Serial Number or Unique Identifier):**  
   - Helps track individual processors for security, warranty, and quality control.  
   - Some CPUs have a unique **CPUID** or **serial number** embedded in firmware, accessible through software.  

2. **Batch Number (Lot Code):**  
   - Identifies a group of CPUs produced under the same manufacturing conditions.  
   - Used for quality control, recalls, and tracking manufacturing defects.  

Most modern processors have both an **externally visible** batch number (often printed on the chip) and an **embedded identifier** in firmware or microcode for software-based verification.  

Would you like details on how to retrieve these numbers from a CPU?
