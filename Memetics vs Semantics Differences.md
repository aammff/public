Memetics vs Semantics Differences

"Memetics" and "semantics" are distinct concepts, though they both deal with meaning and information in different ways.

1. **Memetics**  
   - Memetics is the study of how ideas, behaviors, and cultural elements spread and evolve, similar to biological evolution.  
   - It is based on the concept of "memes," which are units of cultural transmission, like jokes, fashion trends, or religious beliefs.  
   - It was popularized by Richard Dawkins in *The Selfish Gene* (1976), where he compared memes to genes, suggesting they replicate, mutate, and compete for survival.  
   - Example: Internet memes spread through social media as people copy and modify them.

2. **Semantics**  
   - Semantics is the study of meaning in language, symbols, and logic.  
   - It examines how words, phrases, and sentences convey meaning and how meaning can change in different contexts.  
   - It is a core field in linguistics, philosophy, and computer science (e.g., programming languages, AI).  
   - Example: The word "bat" can mean an animal or a sports tool, depending on context.

### Key Differences:
- **Memetics** is about the transmission and evolution of ideas, while **semantics** is about the meaning of words and symbols.
- Memetics is more related to culture, psychology, and evolution, whereas semantics is tied to language, communication, and logic.
- Memetics explains *how* ideas spread, while semantics explains *what* words and symbols mean.
