please check if the analogy savoir to enjoy is as mention to use holds

The analogy "savoir to enjoy is as mention to use" compares the relationship between two pairs of terms. To evaluate its validity, let's break it down:

1. **Savoir to Enjoy**:  
   - In French, *savoir* means "to know."  
   - The relationship between "savoir" and "enjoy" could imply that knowledge or understanding leads to the ability to enjoy something more deeply.  

2. **Mention to Use**:  
   - The relationship here suggests that "mention" (to refer to something) leads to its "use" (to employ or make practical).  

Now let's compare the parallels:  
- In the first pair, the action (knowing) enhances the experience (enjoyment).  
- In the second pair, the action (mentioning) facilitates the outcome (using).  

### Evaluation:
While both pairs suggest a causal relationship, they operate on different levels.  
- "Savoir to enjoy" implies a foundational relationship (knowing improves enjoyment).  
- "Mention to use" implies an initiatory relationship (mentioning prompts usage).  

The analogy is **not very strong**, as the two relationships are not directly analogous in function or logic. Let me know if you'd like a reformulation or further exploration!
