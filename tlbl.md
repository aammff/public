please design a therapeutic programming language having keywords related to challenging mental states and show a sample program. please design an alternative programming language having keywords related to favorable mental states and show a sample program.

Designing therapeutic programming languages with keywords inspired by mental states can be an engaging exercise. One language would focus on acknowledging and addressing challenging mental states, while another would use keywords that represent favorable or positive mental states. The goal would be to express self-reflection, healing, and mental health support through the structure and syntax of each language.

        hold 4;
        exhale 4;
    }
    process {
        self_doubt "I can't do this";
        fear "What if I fail?";
    }
    release {
        breathe {
            inhale 5;
            hold 3;
            exhale 6;
        }
