please explain true meaning "darowanemu koniowi nie zagląda się w zęby"

Darowany koń i zęby

The Polish proverb "darowanemu koniowi nie zagląda się w zęby" translates to "don’t look a gift horse in the mouth." It means that when you receive a gift, you should not criticize or question its quality or value. 

The saying originates from the practice of examining a horse’s teeth to determine its age and health. If someone gives you a horse, it would be rude to inspect it too closely to see if it’s worthy. In essence, the proverb encourages gratitude and appreciation for gifts rather than scrutinizing them or expecting perfection.
