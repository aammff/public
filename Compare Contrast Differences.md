Compare Contrast Differences

Both **"please compare and contrast"** and **"please explain the differences between"** ask for an analysis of differences, but they have slightly different nuances:  

1. **"Please compare and contrast"**  
   - **Compare** means to identify both similarities and differences.  
   - **Contrast** means to focus specifically on the differences.  
   - This phrase asks for both similarities and differences to be discussed.  

2. **"Please explain the differences between"**  
   - This explicitly asks only for the differences, not the similarities.  
   - The focus is on distinguishing two or more things.  

### Example:  
**Compare and contrast apples and oranges:**  
- Similarities: Both are fruits, round, nutritious.  
- Differences: Apples have smooth skin; oranges have a rough, peelable skin. Apples are usually sweet; oranges are citrusy.  

**Explain the differences between apples and oranges:**  
- Apples have smooth skin, while oranges have a thick, bumpy peel.
