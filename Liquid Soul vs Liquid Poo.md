please explain differences between "liquid soul" "liquid poo"

Liquid Soul vs Liquid Poo

The phrases "liquid soul" and "liquid poo" are vastly different in meaning:

1. **Liquid Soul**  
   - Often associated with deep, emotional, or fluid forms of artistic expression, especially in music.  
   - It can refer to a subgenre of drum and bass music called *Liquid Funk* or *Liquid DnB*, known for its smooth, melodic, and soulful vibes.  
   - There's also an artist called *Liquid Soul* known for progressive trance music.  
   - In a metaphorical sense, it can describe something deeply moving or transcendent.

2. **Liquid Poo**  
   - A crude way to describe diarrhea or very loose stool.  
   - Itâ€™s purely a bodily function reference, often used humorously or informally.  
   - Unlike "liquid soul," thereâ€™s nothing deep or artistic about itâ€”just unfortunate digestion.
