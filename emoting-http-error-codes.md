please guess the corresponding http error codes


Mapping emotions to HTTP error codes can be a creative exercise. Here's how each emotion or feeling might correspond to a specific HTTP error code, along with an explanation:

### 1. Sadness (HTTP 404 Not Found)
- **Reason:** The resource the worker is looking for is not found, leading to a sense of sadness.

### 2. Nostalgia (HTTP 410 Gone)
- **Reason:** The resource was once available but is now gone, invoking nostalgia for what was once there.

### 3. Affliction (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error)
- **Reason:** The server encounters an unexpected condition, causing an affliction of errors.

### 4. Greed (HTTP 429 Too Many Requests)
- **Reason:** The worker's greedy behavior of making too many requests leads to rate limiting.

### 5. Envy (HTTP 403 Forbidden)
- **Reason:** The worker is envious because they are forbidden from accessing a resource.

### 6. Resignation (HTTP 503 Service Unavailable)
- **Reason:** The server is temporarily unable to handle the request, leading to a resigned state.

### 7. Impatience (HTTP 408 Request Timeout)
- **Reason:** The worker's impatience leads to a timeout as the server took too long to respond.

### 8. Humiliation (HTTP 400 Bad Request)
- **Reason:** The worker feels humiliated because their request was malformed.

### 9. Shame (HTTP 401 Unauthorized)
- **Reason:** The worker feels shame for not being authorized to access the resource.

### 10. Despair (HTTP 502 Bad Gateway)
- **Reason:** The worker experiences despair due to a bad gateway error, indicating communication problems.

### 11. Worthlessness (HTTP 418 I'm a teapot)
- **Reason:** The worker feels worthless as the server refuses to brew coffee because it is a teapot (a humorous, yet illustrative example).

### 12. Contempt (HTTP 406 Not Acceptable)
- **Reason:** The worker feels contempt because the server cannot produce a response matching the list of acceptable values defined in the request's headers.
