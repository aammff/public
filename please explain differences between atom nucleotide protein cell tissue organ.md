[Biological Organisation Levels]

Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the differences between **atom**, **nucleotide**, **protein**, **cell**, **tissue**, and **organ**, ordered from the smallest to the most complex level of biological organization:

---

### 1. **Atom**  
- **Definition**: The basic unit of matter that forms the building blocks of everything, including living and non-living things. Examples include hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon.  
- **Size**: Extremely small, typically measured in angstroms (1 angstrom = 0.1 nanometers).  
- **Role in Biology**: Atoms like carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen make up the molecules essential for life.

### 2. **Nucleotide**  
- **Definition**: A molecule made up of three parts: a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. It is the basic building block of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).  
- **Size**: Larger than an atom but still microscopic (measured in nanometers).  
- **Role in Biology**:  
  - Nucleotides form DNA and RNA, which store and transfer genetic information.  
  - Examples: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Uracil (U) in RNA.

### 3. **Protein**  
- **Definition**: A large, complex molecule made of amino acids linked together in a specific sequence, folded into unique three-dimensional shapes.  
- **Size**: Larger than nucleotides; sizes vary based on the number of amino acids (measured in nanometers to micrometers).  
- **Role in Biology**:  
  - Proteins perform most of the work in cells, including enzymatic reactions, structural support, and signal transmission.  
  - Examples: Hemoglobin (carries oxygen in blood), insulin (regulates blood sugar).

---

### 4. **Cell**  
- **Definition**: The basic unit of life, made up of various molecules, including proteins, nucleotides, and other biomolecules, encapsulated by a membrane.  
- **Size**: Typically 10–100 micrometers.  
- **Role in Biology**:  
  - Cells are the smallest unit capable of performing all life processes.  
  - Examples: Red blood cells, nerve cells, muscle cells.

---

### 5. **Tissue**  
- **Definition**: A group of cells with similar structure and function, working together to perform a specific task.  
- **Size**: Larger than a single cell, with dimensions depending on the type of tissue and organism.  
- **Role in Biology**:  
  - Tissues form the structural and functional framework of organs.  
  - Examples: Muscle tissue, connective tissue, nervous tissue.

---

### 6. **Organ**  
- **Definition**: A structure composed of multiple tissues working together to perform specific, complex functions.  
- **Size**: Larger than tissue; dimensions vary greatly depending on the organ.  
- **Role in Biology**:  
  - Organs carry out essential life functions for the organism.  
  - Examples: Heart (pumps blood), lungs (enable gas exchange), brain (processes information).

### Summary of Hierarchical Organization:  
- **Atom** → Forms molecules like nucleotides and amino acids.  
- **Nucleotide** → Builds DNA/RNA, which store genetic information.  
- **Protein** → Performs functions within the cell.  
- **Cell** → Basic unit of life, composed of proteins, nucleic acids, and other molecules.  
- **Tissue** → Groups of similar cells that perform a collective function.  
- **Organ** → Structures composed of multiple tissues, performing specialized tasks.

This progression shows how biological systems are built from the smallest chemical units to complex structures.
