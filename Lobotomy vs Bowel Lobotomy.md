please explain differences between "lobotomy "bowel lobotomy"

Lobotomy vs Bowel Lobotomy

A **lobotomy** is a neurosurgical procedure that involves severing connections in the brain's prefrontal cortex. It was historically used to treat mental illnesses but is now widely considered unethical and obsolete due to its severe side effects, such as personality changes, cognitive impairment, and emotional blunting.

A **"bowel lobotomy"** is not a medical term but is sometimes used informally or humorously to describe extreme constipation, severe gastrointestinal distress, or the effects of certain medical procedures on the digestive system. It can refer to a situation where bowel function is severely impaired, either due to surgery, illness, or the use of medications that slow down intestinal activity.

Would you like clarification on anything specific?
