please explain the difference between bootstrappable and self-hosting compilers


The terms **bootstrappable compiler** and **self-hosting compiler** are related to compiler design, but they refer to different concepts. Here's an explanation of each:

### 1. **Bootstrappable Compiler**
A **bootstrappable compiler** is one that can be used to compile itself, but achieving this requires an intermediate process. The term generally implies that the compiler does not yet exist in a usable form for the target platform but can be "bootstrapped" into existence.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Initial Stage**: A bootstrappable compiler often starts with a simpler version or cross-compiled version, written in a different language or for a different platform.
- **Multi-Stage Process**: It might require compiling an initial version of the compiler using another compiler, then using that output to compile the final version.
- **Purpose**: It ensures that the compiler can eventually compile its own source code on the target platform.

**Example**:
Suppose you want a new compiler for a language called *Foo* on a platform where it doesn't exist:
1. Write a minimal *Foo* compiler in a different language (e.g., C).
2. Use an existing C compiler to build this initial version of the *Foo* compiler.
3. Use the resulting *Foo* compiler to compile its full-featured source code.

This process "bootstraps" the system.

### 2. **Self-Hosting Compiler**
A **self-hosting compiler** is one that is written in the language it compiles. For example, a C compiler written in C or a Python interpreter written in Python.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Self-Sufficiency**: The compiler is mature enough to compile its own source code directly.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Since the compiler is written in its own language, developers working on the language itself can easily use the compiler to make changes or improvements.
- **No External Dependencies**: Once a self-hosting compiler is operational, it doesn't rely on other languages or compilers.

**Example**:
- The GNU C Compiler (GCC) was originally written in C, and once it became capable of compiling itself, it became self-hosting.
- The Rust compiler (*rustc*) is written in Rust.

### Key Differences
| **Aspect**              | **Bootstrappable Compiler**                                      | **Self-Hosting Compiler**                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**           | A compiler that can be built in stages to eventually compile itself. | A compiler written in the same language it compiles. |
| **Dependencies**         | Often requires an external or simpler compiler for the initial stage. | Requires no external language after becoming self-hosting. |
| **Purpose**              | To bootstrap a compiler for a language on a target platform.    | To maintain and evolve the language using itself. |
| **Example Process**      | Using a C compiler to build a minimal *Foo* compiler, then using it to compile *Foo*. | A C compiler written in C compiling itself directly. |

### Relation Between the Two
- A compiler must often be **bootstrapped** before it can become **self-hosting**. 
- For example, the Rust compiler was initially developed using OCaml but was eventually rewritten in Rust and became self-hosting after being bootstrapped.
