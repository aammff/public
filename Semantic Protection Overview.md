please explain semantic protection

Semantic Protection Overview

Semantic protection refers to techniques used to safeguard the meaning and integrity of information, especially in computing, cybersecurity, and linguistics. The concept can be applied in various domains:

1. **Cybersecurity & Information Security**  
   - Protecting data from being altered in a way that changes its meaning (e.g., preventing unauthorized modifications to legal or financial documents).
   - Ensuring secure communication by maintaining context and meaning in encrypted messages.

2. **Artificial Intelligence & Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   - Protecting against adversarial attacks where small modifications (like typos or word substitutions) are used to trick AI models into misinterpreting text.
   - Ensuring AI models understand and process language correctly while resisting manipulation.

3. **Software Engineering**  
   - Preventing unintended changes in program semantics during refactoring or optimization.
   - Using type systems and formal verification to ensure code changes do not introduce logical errors.

4. **Data Integrity & Digital Rights Management (DRM)**  
   - Ensuring digital content (e.g., images, videos, text) maintains its intended meaning and cannot be misused or misrepresented.
   - Using watermarking or hashing techniques to verify authenticity.
