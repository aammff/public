please list formally specified programming languages

[Formally Specified Languages]

Formally specified programming languages are those that have a formal definition for their syntax and semantics, often described using formal systems like **context-free grammars**, **operational semantics**, or **denotational semantics**. Hereâ€™s a list of some of the most notable ones:

### **1. Ada**
   - **Specification Method**: Defined using formal grammars for syntax and standardized annotations for semantics.
   - **Notable Use**: Mission-critical systems, defense, and aerospace industries.

### **2. ALGOL (Algorithmic Language)**
   - **Specification Method**: Introduced the **Backus-Naur Form (BNF)** for its syntax.
   - **Notable Use**: A foundational language in the history of programming language development.

### **3. C and C++**
   - **Specification Method**: Defined using formal grammars (like in the ANSI/ISO standards).
   - **Notable Use**: Systems programming, embedded systems, and application development.

### **4. Java**
   - **Specification Method**: Defined in the **Java Language Specification**, which includes formal grammars and descriptions of runtime behavior.
   - **Notable Use**: Web development, enterprise applications, and mobile apps.

### **5. Haskell**
   - **Specification Method**: Defined with formal operational semantics and type systems.
   - **Notable Use**: Functional programming and academic research.

### **6. Prolog**
   - **Specification Method**: Defined using formal rules for logic inference (predicate logic).
   - **Notable Use**: Artificial intelligence and symbolic computation.

### **7. ML (MetaLanguage)**
   - **Specification Method**: Defined with operational semantics and a formal type system.
   - **Notable Use**: Research in programming languages and theorem proving.

### **8. Coq**
   - **Specification Method**: Fully formalized in its syntax and semantics, as Coq itself is a formal proof assistant.
   - **Notable Use**: Formal verification and proof development.

### **9. Eiffel**
   - **Specification Method**: Defined formally with **Design by Contract** principles and clear operational semantics.
   - **Notable Use**: Software engineering and system design.

### **10. Standard ML (SML)**
   - **Specification Method**: Has a formal definition that rigorously specifies syntax, semantics, and type systems.
   - **Notable Use**: Compilers and theorem provers.

### **11. Z (Specification Language)**
   - **Specification Method**: Used for software specification, based on set theory and first-order logic.
   - **Notable Use**: High-assurance systems.

### **12. Lisp**
   - **Specification Method**: Early specifications used formal recursive definitions and lambda calculus.
   - **Notable Use**: AI research and symbolic computation.

### **13. Python (Partially Formalized)**
   - **Specification Method**: Its syntax is defined formally (using context-free grammars), though its semantics are more informally defined.
   - **Notable Use**: General-purpose programming, scripting, and data science.

### **14. Rust**
   - **Specification Method**: Defined with a formal grammar and borrow-checker rules for memory safety.
   - **Notable Use**: Systems programming and performance-critical applications.

### **15. SQL (Structured Query Language)**
   - **Specification Method**: Defined by formal grammar and set-based semantics for data manipulation.
   - **Notable Use**: Database management.

### **16. Verilog and VHDL**
   - **Specification Method**: Defined with formal syntax and semantics for hardware description.
   - **Notable Use**: Hardware design and simulation.

### **17. Scheme**
   - **Specification Method**: Uses formal operational semantics and recursion theories (inspired by lambda calculus).
   - **Notable Use**: Education and research.

### **18. OCaml**
   - **Specification Method**: Has a formally specified syntax and semantics, rooted in ML.
   - **Notable Use**: Industrial applications and programming language research.

### **19. Smalltalk**
   - **Specification Method**: Described with formal operational semantics and message-passing rules.
   - **Notable Use**: Object-oriented programming education and frameworks.

### **20. Fortran**
   - **Specification Method**: Defined with formal syntax and operational semantics.
   - **Notable Use**: Scientific computing and numerical computation.

These languages often serve as benchmarks in both industrial applications and theoretical computer science due to their precise definitions.
