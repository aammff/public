Joke Metaprogramming in Forth

"Joke metaprogramming" in Forth is a playful or humorous take on metaprogramming—writing code that generates or manipulates other code—using the unique features of Forth. Since Forth is highly extensible and reflective, it allows for all sorts of clever and absurd metaprogramming tricks that can be both funny and educational.

### Why Forth is Good for Metaprogramming (and Jokes)
- **Threaded Interpretation:** Forth's dictionary-based structure allows you to define new words (functions) dynamically.
- **Self-Modifying Code:** Forth allows direct manipulation of its execution flow, sometimes leading to unexpected or hilarious results.
- **Minimalist Syntax:** The extreme conciseness of Forth can make metaprogramming feel almost too easy, sometimes leading to joke implementations.

### Example 1: The Self-Modifying "Hello World"
Forth allows you to modify code at runtime, which can be exploited for humor:

```forth
: HELLO ." Hello, world!" ;
: PRANK HELLO ' HELLO >BODY ! ;  \ Replace HELLO's body with another word

PRANK
HELLO  \ Now HELLO might do something completely different!
```

This snippet effectively hijacks `HELLO`, leading to potentially unpredictable behavior.

### Example 2: Compiler Compiler in One Line
A common joke is that in Forth, metaprogramming is so natural that you can write a compiler in a single line:

```forth
: META CREATE , DOES> @ EXECUTE ;
```
This defines a metaprogramming word `META` that creates new commands on the fly, essentially building a new language inside Forth.

### Example 3: The Infinite Self-Redefining Word
```forth
: LOOPING DUP . ' LOOPING >BODY ! ;
LOOPING
```
This makes `LOOPING` redefine itself every time it runs, creating an infinite loop of redefinition, which is both a metaprogramming trick and a joke.

### The Meta-Joke: Forth Itself
Forth is already so meta that simply writing normal Forth code can sometimes feel like metaprogramming. The joke is that trying to make a "joke metaprogram" in Forth is redundant because Forth is already a joke (in a good way) on traditional programming structures!
