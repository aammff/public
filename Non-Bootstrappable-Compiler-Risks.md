are non-bootstrappable compilers of gc languages a health risk?


Non-bootstrappable compilers of garbage-collected (GC) languages are not directly a health risk in the conventional sense (e.g., to physical or mental health). However, they could be considered a potential "risk" in the context of software reliability, security, and trustworthiness, which might have broader societal or technological impacts.

### What is a Non-Bootstrappable Compiler?
A non-bootstrappable compiler is one that cannot be built using its own source code. In contrast, a bootstrappable compiler can compile itself, enhancing trust by allowing its users to verify its integrity through the source code.

### Potential "Risks" of Non-Bootstrappable GC Language Compilers:
1. **Trust and Integrity:**
   - If a compiler is non-bootstrappable, it relies on a separate, potentially opaque binary or compiler to be built. This could open avenues for backdoors, malicious code, or unintentional bugs, undermining trust.
   - The lack of transparency might impact industries where software integrity is crucial, such as healthcare or critical infrastructure.

2. **Environmental or Psychological Health Risks:**
   - While indirect, compromised or unreliable software in industries like healthcare (e.g., medical devices running GC languages) could potentially harm human health.
   - The stress or anxiety caused by debugging or relying on untrustworthy tools might impact developers' mental health, especially in high-stakes environments.

3. **Sustainability and Maintenance Risks:**
   - A non-bootstrappable ecosystem can hinder long-term sustainability. If the external tools required to build the compiler become obsolete or compromised, this could disrupt systems relying on the language.

### Addressing the Issue:
1. **Encouraging Bootstrappable Design:**
   - Ensures that the compiler can be independently verified and rebuilt, promoting security and trust.
   
2. **Auditing and Open-Source Practices:**
   - Open, well-audited software can mitigate risks even if non-bootstrappable.

3. **System Design for Safety-Critical Applications:**
   - For systems in health-critical environments, redundancy, thorough testing, and fallback mechanisms can reduce the reliance on potentially flawed compilers.

While the direct link to physical health risks is tenuous, the long-term implications of compromised trust in software could cascade into more tangible risks, including those impacting health-critical systems.
