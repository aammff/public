please explain differences between: wget curl lynx links w3m

[Command-line tools comparison]

The tools **`wget`**, **`curl`**, **`lynx`**, **`links`**, and **`w3m`** are all command-line utilities commonly used to interact with web resources, but each serves slightly different purposes and caters to different use cases. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

---

### **1. `wget`**
- **Purpose**: A non-interactive network downloader.
- **Primary Use Case**: Downloading files or entire websites.
- **Key Features**:
  - Can download entire websites recursively using `--recursive`.
  - Supports resuming downloads using `--continue`.
  - Works with FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols.
  - Very lightweight and non-interactive (perfect for automation or scripts).
- **Limitations**: Cannot perform advanced HTTP interactions like sending POST requests or handling APIs easily.
- **Example**: 
  ```bash
  wget http://example.com/file.zip
  wget --recursive --no-parent http://example.com/folder/
  ```

### **2. `curl`**
- **Purpose**: A versatile tool for transferring data with URLs.
- **Primary Use Case**: Interacting with web services, APIs, and downloading/uploading data.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports many protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, SCP, LDAP, etc.).
  - Allows HTTP POST/PUT requests, setting headers, sending JSON data, and handling cookies.
  - Outputs data directly to the terminal (stdout), unless redirected.
  - Highly customizable for advanced networking tasks.
- **Limitations**: Not as straightforward as `wget` for recursive downloads.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  curl -O http://example.com/file.zip  # Download file
  curl -X POST -d "key=value" http://example.com/api  # Send POST request
  ```

---

### **3. `lynx`**
- **Purpose**: A text-based web browser.
- **Primary Use Case**: Browsing web pages in a terminal.
- **Key Features**:
  - Displays web pages in plain text (no images or modern CSS/JavaScript support).
  - Can follow links interactively in the terminal.
  - Supports basic web browsing, form submission, and cookies.
  - Great for accessibility and very lightweight.
- **Limitations**: Limited to plain text rendering; not ideal for modern web content.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  lynx http://example.com
  ```

### **4. `links`**
- **Purpose**: A text-based web browser with basic graphics support.
- **Primary Use Case**: Similar to `lynx`, but with slightly better rendering and optional graphical mode.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports frames, tables, and basic rendering of some graphical elements.
  - Can work in both text-only mode or with limited graphical support (via SVGALib or X11).
  - Also allows downloading files like `wget`.
- **Limitations**: Still lacks support for modern web features (JavaScript-heavy pages).
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  links http://example.com
  ```

### **5. `w3m`**
- **Purpose**: A text-based web browser with inline image support.
- **Primary Use Case**: Similar to `lynx` and `links`, but supports displaying images within the terminal (if configured).
- **Key Features**:
  - Inline image support (if using a compatible terminal like `xterm` or `kitty`).
  - Supports basic HTML rendering, tables, and frames.
  - Can also be used as a pager (like `less`) to view local HTML files.
  - Very lightweight.
- **Limitations**: Similar to `lynx` and `links`, lacks modern web capabilities.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  w3m http://example.com
  ```

### **Key Comparisons**
| Tool    | Interactive | Primary Focus              | Protocols Supported       | Special Feature                      |
|---------|-------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `wget`  | No          | File downloading          | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP          | Recursive downloads, resumable       |
| `curl`  | No          | Data transfer/APIs         | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.    | HTTP POST/PUT, API interactions      |
| `lynx`  | Yes         | Text-based web browsing   | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP          | Simplest text-based browser          |
| `links` | Yes         | Text-based browsing       | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP          | Text-based + some graphical features |
| `w3m`   | Yes         | Text-based browsing       | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP          | Inline image support                 |

### **Choosing the Right Tool**
- **Use `wget`**: For downloading files or websites (especially recursively).
- **Use `curl`**: For interacting with APIs or performing custom HTTP requests.
- **Use `lynx`, `links`, or `w3m`**: For browsing websites in a terminal or in low-resource environments. Choose `w3m` for inline image support, `links` for basic graphics, or `lynx` for simplicity.
