please explain why lego figurines have no hands

Lego Minifigure Hand Design

Lego figurines actually do have hands—though their design is unique and minimalist. The hands of Lego minifigures are shaped like small, cylindrical, semi-circular hooks rather than detailed fingers. This design is intentional and serves several practical purposes:

1. **Attachment Mechanism**: 
   The semi-circular shape allows the hands to easily grip Lego accessories, like swords, tools, or steering wheels, without needing complex finger articulation. It also ensures the accessories stay securely in place.

2. **Simplified Manufacturing**: 
   The simple, rounded design is easier and cheaper to produce than attempting to replicate detailed, articulated hands. This helps keep Lego pieces durable and cost-effective.

3. **Durability**: 
   The sturdy, minimalist design reduces the risk of breakage compared to delicate fingers, ensuring the figurines can withstand rough play.

4. **Aesthetic Consistency**: 
   Lego's design philosophy is based on simplicity and modularity. The hands match the blocky, cartoon-like style of the rest of the figure, creating a cohesive look.

So, while Lego minifigures don’t have articulated fingers, their unique "hand" design is a deliberate and functional choice.
