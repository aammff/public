please explain following joke "co to jest ani ziębi ani grzeje? zepsuta lodówka lub grzejnik"

Zartobliwe wyjaśnienie dowcipu

This joke is a play on the Polish phrase **"ani ziębi, ani grzeje"**, which literally translates to **"neither chills nor warms"** and is commonly used to mean **"I don't care"** or **"it makes no difference to me"**.

The punchline—**"zepsuta lodówka lub grzejnik"** (**"a broken fridge or heater"**)—takes the phrase literally. If a fridge is broken, it doesn't cool (doesn't "chill"), and if a heater is broken, it doesn't warm—so they both literally fit the phrase.

The humor comes from the double meaning: the phrase is normally figurative, but the joke turns it into a literal statement.
