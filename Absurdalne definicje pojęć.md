please explain the joke "co to jest inteligencja? dziura w zębie. co to jest płodność? szczepionka"

Absurdalne definicje pojęć

This joke plays on absurd or nonsensical definitions of words to create humor. Here's the breakdown:

1. **"Co to jest inteligencja? Dziura w zębie."**
   - The question asks, "What is intelligence?" and gives the unexpected answer: "A hole in a tooth." 
   - The humor comes from the ridiculous mismatch between the question and the answer. Normally, intelligence refers to cognitive abilities, but here, it’s equated with a dental issue, which makes no logical sense.

2. **"Co to jest płodność? Szczepionka."**
   - The question asks, "What is fertility?" and provides the equally absurd answer: "A vaccine."
   - The humor similarly comes from the dissonance. Fertility is about the ability to reproduce, while a vaccine has no direct connection to this concept. 

This kind of humor, where words are given deliberately absurd definitions, is often appreciated for its surreal or nonsensical qualities. It plays with the expectations of the listener, who is anticipating a sensible explanation, only to be met with something completely unrelated and irrational.
