please explain differences between books, comics, movies, computer games

Books, comics, movies, and computer games are all storytelling mediums, but they differ significantly in how they present narratives, engage audiences, and use visual, textual, and interactive elements. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of their differences:

---

### **1. Books**
- **Nature**: Primarily textual.
- **Narrative Delivery**: Relies on written words to describe scenes, emotions, and actions.
- **Imagination**: Encourages readers to visualize settings, characters, and events in their own minds.
- **Pacing**: Controlled by the reader, who can pause, re-read, or skip sections at will.
- **Interactivity**: Minimal; the experience is largely linear and solitary.
- **Advantages**: Allows for deep character development and extensive world-building through detailed descriptions and inner monologues.

---

### **2. Comics**
- **Nature**: A combination of visual art and text.
- **Narrative Delivery**: Uses panels with illustrations, speech bubbles, and captions to tell stories.
- **Imagination**: Provides a mix of fixed visuals and textual cues, leaving some room for the reader's imagination.
- **Pacing**: Still controlled by the reader, but the visual element guides the flow and mood.
- **Interactivity**: Minimal; typically linear with occasional freedom to explore details in panels.
- **Advantages**: Strong visual impact, succinct storytelling, and the ability to quickly convey action or emotion through art.

### **3. Movies**
- **Nature**: Fully audiovisual.
- **Narrative Delivery**: Presents a pre-determined sequence of moving images, sound, and dialogue to tell stories.
- **Imagination**: Leaves less to the imagination, as visuals and sounds depict the story explicitly.
- **Pacing**: Fixed; determined by the filmmakers and cannot be altered by the viewer.
- **Interactivity**: Nonexistent in traditional formats; the experience is passive.
- **Advantages**: Immersive storytelling with the ability to leverage music, cinematography, and acting to create emotional depth and spectacle.

### **4. Computer Games**
- **Nature**: Interactive audiovisual medium.
- **Narrative Delivery**: Blends visual, textual, and auditory elements with player agency to progress the story.
- **Imagination**: Varies; some games provide detailed visuals, while others leave more room for interpretation.
- **Pacing**: Partly controlled by the player, allowing for exploration, decision-making, and varied outcomes.
- **Interactivity**: High; players actively participate in shaping or experiencing the narrative.
- **Advantages**: Offers unique immersion by combining storytelling with gameplay mechanics, such as solving puzzles, fighting battles, or making choices that impact the story.
