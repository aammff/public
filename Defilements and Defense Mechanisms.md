 Mātsarya - selfishness
 Īrṣyā - envy
 Pradāśa - spite
 Vihiṃsā - violence
 Upanāha - vengefulness
 Śāṭhya - deception

{"Abhidhamma: ten defilements and unwholesome roots" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleshas_(Buddhism)]:
 greed (lobha)
 hatred (dosa)
 delusion (moha)
 conceit (māna)
 wrong views (micchāditthi)
 doubt (vicikicchā)
 torpor (thīnaṃ)
 restlessness (uddhaccaṃ)
 shamelessness (ahirikaṃ)
 recklessness (anottappaṃ)
}

{"defense mechanisms" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freud%27s_psychoanalytic_theories]:
 1) Denial is believing that what is true is actually false
 2) Displacement is taking out impulses on a less threatening target
 3) Intellectualization is avoiding unacceptable emotions by focusing on the intellectual aspects
 4) Projection is attributing uncomfortable feelings to others
 5) Rationalization is creating false but believable justifications
 6) Reaction Formation is taking the opposite belief because the true belief causes anxiety
 7) Regression is going back to a previous stage of development
 8) Repression is pushing uncomfortable thoughts out of conscious awareness
 9) Suppression is consciously forcing unwanted thoughts out of our awareness
 10) Sublimation is redirecting ‘wrong’ urges into socially acceptable actions.

Here’s a comparative analysis of the three frameworks: **Parittaklesabhūmika (limited defilements), Abhidhamma defilements, and Freud's defense mechanisms**. Although these lists arise from different philosophical, psychological, and cultural contexts, they offer insights into the human mind's ways of dealing with challenges, emotions, and moral struggles.

---

### **1. Nature of the Constructs**
- **Parittaklesabhūmika (Limited Defilements):**
  - Focused on subtle moral and emotional flaws arising from a defiled state of mind in Buddhism.
  - Includes emotions like anger (krodha) and behaviors like deceit (māyā) that hinder ethical and spiritual progress.

- **Abhidhamma Defilements:**
  - A detailed Buddhist psychological framework addressing roots of suffering (kleshas).
  - Focuses on unwholesome mental factors and attitudes (e.g., greed, delusion) that perpetuate samsara (cyclic existence).

- **Freud's Defense Mechanisms:**
  - A psychoanalytic concept describing how the mind protects itself from anxiety or guilt.
  - Operates as coping strategies (often unconscious) to manage internal conflicts.

---

### **2. Overlapping Themes**
- **Anger and Hatred:**
  - **Parittaklesabhūmika**: Krodha (anger) and Upanāha (vengefulness) deal with hostility.
  - **Abhidhamma**: Dosa (hatred) is a root defilement.
  - **Freud**: Displacement (redirecting anger) and Reaction Formation (masking anger) are ways to manage hostility.

- **Deception and Dishonesty:**
  - **Parittaklesabhūmika**: Māyā (deceit) and Śāṭhya (deception) address dishonest behavior.
  - **Abhidhamma**: Wrong views (micchāditthi) and conceit (māna) could include self-deception.
  - **Freud**: Rationalization and Projection involve lying to oneself or misattributing blame.

- **Pride and Conceit:**
  - **Parittaklesabhūmika**: Mada (pride) highlights inflated ego.
  - **Abhidhamma**: Māna (conceit) is a root defilement tied to ego.
  - **Freud**: Denial and Intellectualization might shield an individual from confronting vulnerabilities that threaten pride.

- **Envy and Jealousy:**
  - **Parittaklesabhūmika**: Īrṣyā (envy) and Mātsarya (selfishness) express discontent over others' advantages.
  - **Abhidhamma**: Greed (lobha) relates to clinging and covetousness.
  - **Freud**: Sublimation might redirect envy into ambition or competition.

- **Violence and Harm:**
  - **Parittaklesabhūmika**: Vihiṃsā (violence) reflects harmful intent.
  - **Abhidhamma**: Hatred (dosa) can manifest as aggression.
  - **Freud**: Sublimation could transform violent impulses into constructive outlets.

---

### **3. Divergences**
- **Moral vs. Psychological Focus:**
  - **Buddhist frameworks** (Parittaklesabhūmika, Abhidhamma): Ethical concerns drive these lists, emphasizing actions and states leading to suffering.
  - **Freud's mechanisms**: Concerned with managing psychic tension, not morality.

- **Root Causes vs. Mechanisms:**
  - **Buddhism**: Emphasizes eradication of underlying causes (lobha, dosa, moha).
  - **Freud**: Highlights how people cope, sometimes avoiding confronting root issues.

- **Conscious vs. Unconscious Processes:**
  - **Buddhist lists**: Include states observable through introspection.
  - **Freud's list**: Largely unconscious strategies, with some (e.g., Suppression) requiring conscious effort.

---

### **4. Complementary Insights**
- Both traditions agree on the destructive potential of greed, hatred, and delusion, though Buddhism presents them as roots of existence, while Freud interprets them as manageable drives.
- Freud’s defense mechanisms, such as Sublimation, align with the Buddhist ideal of transforming negative impulses (e.g., redirecting lobha into generosity).
- The Buddhist lists aim for liberation through ethical and meditative refinement, whereas Freud’s mechanisms aim to maintain psychological balance and functioning.

---

### **Concluding Insights**
While arising from distinct contexts, these frameworks reveal universal truths about human struggles with desire, anger, and delusion. Buddhist teachings encourage eliminating these traits to attain liberation, while Freud’s mechanisms aim to manage them for psychological health. Together, they provide a rich, complementary understanding of the mind.
