RLE Algorithm with Skew Binary in Haskell, Prolog

The Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm is a simple form of data compression where consecutive repeated elements are stored as a single data value and a count. Implementing RLE using the skew binary number system in Haskell and Prolog involves different approaches due to the inherent differences in the languages' paradigms—Haskell being a functional language and Prolog being a logic-based language.

### Haskell Implementation

Haskell, being a purely functional language, allows for concise and expressive implementations of algorithms like RLE. The skew binary number system can be used to efficiently represent numbers, which can be beneficial in certain contexts of RLE.

Here’s a possible implementation of RLE using the skew binary number system in Haskell:

```haskell
-- Define a skew binary number as a list of digits
type SkewBinary = [Int]

-- Convert a skew binary number to an integer
skewToInt :: SkewBinary -> Int
skewToInt = foldl (\acc (i, x) -> acc + x * (2^i - 1)) 0 . zip [0..]

-- Convert an integer to a skew binary number
intToSkew :: Int -> SkewBinary
intToSkew 0 = []
intToSkew n = intToSkew (n `div` 2) ++ [n `mod` 2]

-- Run-Length Encoding using skew binary numbers
rle :: [Char] -> [(Char, SkewBinary)]
rle [] = []
rle (x:xs) = (x, intToSkew (length run)) : rle rest
  where
    (run, rest) = span (== x) (x:xs)

-- Example usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let input = "aaabbbccca"
  let encoded = rle input
  print encoded
  let decoded = concatMap (\(c, skew) -> replicate (skewToInt skew) c) encoded
  print decoded
```

### Prolog Implementation

Prolog, being a logic-based language, requires a different approach. The skew binary number system can be represented as a list of digits, and the RLE algorithm can be implemented using recursive predicates.

Here’s a possible implementation of RLE using the skew binary number system in Prolog:

```prolog
% Convert a skew binary number to an integer
skew_to_int(Skew, Int) :-
    skew_to_int(Skew, 0, Int).

skew_to_int([], Acc, Acc).
skew_to_int([H|T], Acc, Int) :-
    Acc1 is Acc + H * (2^length(T) - 1),
    skew_to_int(T, Acc1, Int).

% Convert an integer to a skew binary number
int_to_skew(0, []).
int_to_skew(N, Skew) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N div 2,
    int_to_skew(N1, Skew1),
    Digit is N mod 2,
    append(Skew1, [Digit], Skew).

% Run-Length Encoding using skew binary numbers
rle([], []).
rle([X|Xs], [(X, Skew)|Rest]) :-
    run_length(X, [X|Xs], Run, Remaining),
    length(Run, Length),
    int_to_skew(Length, Skew),
    rle(Remaining, Rest).

% Helper predicate to find the run of the same character
run_length(_, [], [], []).
run_length(X, [X|Xs], [X|Run], Remaining) :-
    run_length(X, Xs, Run, Remaining).
run_length(X, [Y|Ys], [], [Y|Ys]) :-
    X \= Y.

% Example usage
example :-
    Input = [a, a, a, b, b, b, c, c, c, a],
    rle(Input, Encoded),
    write('Encoded: '), write(Encoded), nl,
    decode(Encoded, Decoded),
    write('Decoded: '), write(Decoded), nl.

% Decode the RLE back to the original list
decode([], []).
decode([(X, Skew)|Rest], Decoded) :-
    skew_to_int(Skew, Length),
    replicate(X, Length, Replicated),
    decode(Rest, RestDecoded),
    append(Replicated, RestDecoded, Decoded).

% Helper predicate to replicate a character N times
replicate(_, 0, []).
replicate(X, N, [X|Rest]) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    replicate(X, N1, Rest).
```

### Comparison

- **Paradigm**: Haskell's functional paradigm allows for a more mathematical and concise implementation, while Prolog's logic-based paradigm requires a more procedural and recursive approach.
- **Type System**: Haskell's strong type system ensures type safety and can catch errors at compile time, whereas Prolog's dynamic typing allows for more flexibility but less safety.
- **Expressiveness**: Haskell's syntax is more suited for mathematical transformations and higher-order functions, making the implementation of RLE with skew binary numbers more straightforward. Prolog, on the other hand, requires more explicit handling of recursion and list manipulation.
- **Performance**: Haskell's lazy evaluation can lead to more efficient memory usage in some cases, while Prolog's backtracking mechanism can be both a strength and a weakness depending on the problem.

Both implementations achieve the same goal but are tailored to the strengths and idiomatic practices of their respective languages.
