please explain differences between "linear type" "polymorphic type" "negative type" "fractional type"

[Type System Differences Explained]

The terms "linear type," "polymorphic type," "negative type," and "fractional type" are concepts from programming language theory and type systems. Below is an explanation of each:

---

### **1. Linear Type**
- **Definition:** Linear types enforce a usage policy where each value of the type must be used exactly once.
- **Key Features:**
  - Values cannot be copied or discarded.
  - Useful for managing resources like file handles or memory regions in a way that ensures safety.
- **Example Use Cases:**
  - In functional programming languages like Haskell (via libraries) or Rust (via ownership model).
- **Why It Matters:** Linear types help avoid resource leaks and ensure deterministic resource cleanup.
- **Example:**
  ```rust
  let file = File::open("example.txt"); // `file` is linear
  file.read(); // Consumes `file`
  file.read(); // Error: `file` already consumed
  ```

### **2. Polymorphic Type**
- **Definition:** A polymorphic type can take multiple forms, allowing a function or data structure to operate on various types without being rewritten.
- **Key Features:**
  - Can be **parametric** (generic types) or **ad-hoc** (overloading).
  - Common in functional programming and object-oriented programming.
- **Example Use Cases:**
  - Generics in programming languages like Java, C++, and Haskell.
- **Why It Matters:** Increases code reusability and abstraction.
- **Example:**
  ```haskell
  -- Parametric polymorphism in Haskell
  id :: a -> a
  id x = x
  ```

### **3. Negative Type**
- **Definition:** Refers to types involving negation, typically in the context of logic and type theory (e.g., dualities in category theory or continuations in functional programming).
- **Key Features:**
  - May arise in languages with advanced type systems where negation corresponds to logical or type-theoretic concepts.
  - Often used in continuations and effects modeling.
- **Example Use Cases:**
  - Continuation-passing style (CPS) or control operators like `call/cc`.
- **Why It Matters:** Enables expressing concepts like "negating" computations or logical propositions.
- **Example:** A type like `¬A` (negation of type `A`) can be understood as a function `A -> ⊥` (from `A` to the bottom type, representing an impossibility).

---

### **4. Fractional Type**
- **Definition:** Fractional types involve concepts where types can represent "fractions" or proportions, often in resource analysis or advanced type systems.
- **Key Features:**
  - Often theoretical, arising in linear logic or quantitative type systems.
  - Used to track fractional ownership or usage of resources.
- **Example Use Cases:**
  - Fractional permissions in concurrency, such as in verification tools.
- **Why It Matters:** Provides fine-grained control over resource management.
- **Example:** A fractional type system might allow 50% ownership of a resource, enabling controlled sharing.
