please explain following joke "czym się różni betoniarka od mieszalnika pasz? stawką vat. czym się różni bułka od dildo? stawką vat"

Różnice w stawce VAT

This joke is a play on the differences in VAT (Value-Added Tax) rates applied to different products in Poland.  

### Explanation:  
1. **"Czym się różni betoniarka od mieszalnika pasz? Stawką VAT."**  
   - This means: "What is the difference between a concrete mixer and a feed mixer? The VAT rate."  
   - Both machines are similar in function (mixing materials), but they are taxed differently. This highlights how tax laws can create seemingly arbitrary distinctions.

2. **"Czym się różni bułka od dildo? Stawką VAT."**  
   - This means: "What is the difference between a bread roll and a dildo? The VAT rate."  
   - Again, the humor comes from the absurdity of comparing two completely unrelated items solely based on taxation rules.  

### The Humor:  
The joke mocks how tax systems can apply different VAT rates to products that, while functionally different, don’t necessarily have an intuitive reason for differing taxation. It’s especially funny because the second comparison (bread vs. a dildo) is absurdly extreme, making the joke more unexpected and amusing.  

Would you like more details on Polish VAT rules that inspired this? 😆
