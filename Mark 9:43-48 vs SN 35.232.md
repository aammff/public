"Mark 9:43-48" and "SN 35.232" represent passages from two different religious traditions: Christianity and Buddhism, respectively.

### **Mark 9:43-48** (Christianity)
This passage is from the New Testament, where Jesus uses hyperbolic language to stress the importance of avoiding sin and achieving eternal life:

- **Content**: Jesus says, *“If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.”* This is repeated for other body parts (foot, eye), symbolizing the need to remove anything that causes sin.
- **Meaning**: 
  - Jesus uses vivid metaphors to underscore the severity of sin and the urgency of addressing it. 
  - He emphasizes the eternal consequences of unrepented sin (depicted as hell, or Gehenna) versus the reward of eternal life.
  - The imagery of cutting off body parts is not literal but symbolic of radical self-discipline.
- **Focus**: Avoiding sin, the gravity of eternal damnation, and prioritizing eternal life over earthly pleasures or comforts.

### **SN 35.232** (Buddhism)
This passage is from the Saṃyutta Nikāya, a collection of Buddhist teachings, and specifically pertains to the control of the senses:

- **Content**: The Buddha advises abandoning attachment to sensory experiences to overcome suffering. For example, if the eye (or other sense organs) leads to unwholesome states, one should train to let go of attachment to the sense object.
- **Meaning**:
  - The teaching emphasizes mindfulness and restraint of the senses to avoid craving and suffering (dukkha).
  - Rather than advocating physical harm, it focuses on mental discipline and cultivating detachment from sensory pleasures that lead to suffering.
  - The ultimate goal is liberation (nirvana), achieved by overcoming attachment and ignorance.
- **Focus**: Avoiding craving and clinging to sensory experiences, which perpetuate the cycle of suffering (samsara).
