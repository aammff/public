what is the approximate number of currently living persons who have covered distance of three marathons in one day? thorough history?


The number of people who have run the equivalent of three marathons (78.6 miles or 126.6 kilometers) in a single day is relatively small, even in modern times, but it's not an exact figure that is regularly tracked. Here's a breakdown to consider:
Modern Context

    Ultramarathon Runners:
        Many ultramarathon events require participants to cover distances of 50 miles (80.5 km), 100 km, or even 100 miles within 24 hours. Some events allow a 24-hour cutoff for "daylong" efforts.
        High-profile ultramarathons like the Badwater 135, Western States 100, or Spartathlon see hundreds of participants annually.
        The International Association of Ultrarunners (IAU) tracks thousands of ultramarathon runners globally, but not all complete 78.6 miles in a single day.

    Elite Endurance Athletes:
        Many elite athletes, including adventurers and multi-sport athletes, regularly cover long distances in a single day during events or training.

    Endurance Challenges:
        Extreme endurance feats, such as long charity runs or individual challenges, often involve distances over three marathons. However, these are far less common.

Historical Context

    Military and Exploration:
        In history, some messengers, soldiers, and explorers may have covered distances equivalent to three marathons in a day under exceptional circumstances (e.g., ancient foot messengers, Native American runners, and certain wartime couriers). However, these feats were likely rare and undocumented.

    Cultural and Religious Practices:
        Some traditional endurance practices in Indigenous and religious contexts (e.g., running pilgrimages) might have involved similar distances, but documentation is sparse.

Estimate of Living Individuals

While there's no precise count, a reasonable estimate of currently living individuals who have covered 78.6 miles in one day is likely in the tens of thousands globally, considering:

    The growing popularity of ultramarathons.
    The inclusion of modern adventurers and extreme endurance athletes.
