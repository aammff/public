- **Connotation**: Implies lack of individual thought or critical decision-making.
- **Example**: "The team acted like lemmings, following the risky strategy without question."

### **Cannon Fodder**

### **Push-over**

### Key Differences:
- **Lemmings**: Act out of conformity, often in groups, and may harm themselves unintentionally.
- **Benefactor**: Acts out of generosity, helping others intentionally and positively.
- **Cannon Fodder**: Used and sacrificed by others, often with no personal benefit or acknowledgment.
- **Push-over**: Allows others to take advantage of them due to lack of resistance or assertiveness.

These terms differ primarily in their agency, intent, and whether the action is self-initiated or imposed by others.
