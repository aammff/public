Uczciwa częściowo indukowana pomyłka

The phrase "uczciwa częściowo indukowana pomyłka" can be translated from Polish to English as "an honest partially induced mistake." Here's a breakdown of the meaning:

1. **Uczciwa**: Honest, fair, or sincere. It implies that the action or situation was not deceitful or malicious.
2. **Częściowo**: Partially, meaning not entirely or to some degree.
3. **Indukowana**: Induced or caused. This suggests that the mistake resulted from some external influence or conditions.
4. **Pomyłka**: Mistake, error, or misunderstanding.

### Combined Meaning:
The phrase refers to a situation where a mistake occurred honestly (without ill intent) and was partly caused or influenced by external factors. It might be used to describe scenarios where someone made an error due to circumstances beyond their full control but still acted in good faith. 

For example:
- A person misunderstands instructions due to unclear communication but genuinely tried to follow them.
- A decision-maker errs because of incomplete or misleading information provided to them.
