Lipstick vs Condom Differences

"**Lipstick**" and "**condom**" are completely different products with distinct purposes:  

- **Lipstick**: A cosmetic product applied to the lips to add color, texture, and sometimes moisture. It is commonly used for beauty and self-expression.  
- **Condom**: A protective barrier device, typically made of latex, polyurethane, or polyisoprene, used during sexual activity to prevent pregnancy and reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  

In short, lipstick is for **aesthetic enhancement**, while a condom is for **sexual protection**. Let me know if you need a more detailed comparison!
