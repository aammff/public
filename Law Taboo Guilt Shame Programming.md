please explain differences between "law" "taboo" "guilt" "shame" "declarative programming" "imperative programming"

Law Taboo Guilt Shame Programming

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each term and how they differ:

### **Law vs. Taboo**  
- **Law**: A formal, codified rule enforced by an authority (e.g., government). Violating a law can result in legal consequences like fines or imprisonment.  
  - Example: Speeding is against the law and can lead to a ticket.  
- **Taboo**: A strong social or cultural prohibition, often unwritten but deeply ingrained. Breaking a taboo results in social disapproval rather than legal punishment.  
  - Example: In some cultures, eating certain foods (like pork or beef) is taboo, but not illegal.  

ðŸ’¡ **Key Difference**: Laws are legally enforced, while taboos are socially enforced.

### **Guilt vs. Shame**  
- **Guilt**: A feeling of remorse for **something you did** that goes against your moral values. Itâ€™s internal and focused on actions.  
  - Example: You feel guilty for lying to a friend.  
- **Shame**: A feeling of worthlessness or humiliation due to a perceived **flaw in yourself**, often influenced by how others see you.  
  - Example: You feel shame if you are publicly humiliated for failing an exam.  

ðŸ’¡ **Key Difference**: Guilt is about **what you did**, while shame is about **who you are (or how you think others see you)**.

### **Declarative vs. Imperative Programming**  
- **Declarative Programming**: You describe **what** you want the program to do, without specifying **how** to do it. The system figures out the steps.  
  - Example: SQL (`SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;`) â†’ You state what you want (adults), but the system decides how to get the data.  
- **Imperative Programming**: You specify **how** the program should achieve the goal, step by step.  
  - Example: Python  
    ```python
    adults = []
    for user in users:
        if user.age > 18:
            adults.append(user)
    ```
    Here, you explicitly tell the computer how to filter users.  

ðŸ’¡ **Key Difference**: Declarative describes **what** should happen, while imperative specifies **how** it should happen.
