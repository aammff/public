Polish phrase differences explained: word order and emphasis

The phrases **"skąd to się wzięło"** and **"skąd się to wzięło"** are very similar in meaning, but they differ slightly in word order, which can affect emphasis or tone. Both translate to **"where did this come from?"** or **"how did this come about?"** in English. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

### 1. **"Skąd to się wzięło"**
   - **Word order**: "to" (this) comes before the reflexive pronoun "się."
   - **Emphasis**: This phrasing is more neutral and straightforward. It places slightly more emphasis on **"to"** (this), making it the focal point of the question.
   - **Usage**: This is the more common and natural word order in everyday speech.

   Example:  
   *"Skąd to się wzięło?"*  
   *"Where did this come from?"*

### 2. **"Skąd się to wzięło"**
   - **Word order**: The reflexive pronoun "się" comes before "to."
   - **Emphasis**: This phrasing places slightly more emphasis on the action or process (**"się wzięło"**), making it sound a bit more reflective or contemplative.
   - **Usage**: This order is also correct but may sound slightly more formal or poetic. It’s less common in casual conversation.

   Example:  
   *"Skąd się to wzięło?"*  
   *"Where did this come from?"* (with a bit more focus on the process of it coming into existence.)

### Key Difference:
- **"Skąd to się wzięło"** is more neutral and commonly used.
- **"Skąd się to wzięło"** is slightly more formal or reflective, with a subtle shift in emphasis.

Both are grammatically correct and convey the same basic meaning, so the choice depends on the tone or style you want to use.
