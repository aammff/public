1. **Paw (English or Polish)**: 
   - In English, a "paw" refers to the foot of an animal, especially a mammal like a dog or cat.
   - In Polish, "paw" can mean a peacock (a bird with beautiful, colorful feathers).
   
2. **Rzyg (Polish)**:
   - This is a slang Polish word that roughly translates to "vomit" in English. It's a colloquial term for throwing up.

3. **Wymiot (Polish)**:
   - This is the standard Polish word for "vomit" or "throw-up." Unlike "rzyg," it is more neutral and less slangy.

4. **Fraktal (Polish/English)**:
   - A fractal (fraktal in Polish) is a complex geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the whole. Fractals are often used in mathematics, art, and nature to describe intricate patterns like snowflakes, coastlines, or certain types of artwork.

### Summary:
- **Paw** could mean an animal's foot (English) or a peacock (Polish).
- **Rzyg** and **wymiot** both mean vomit in Polish, with "rzyg" being more informal.
- **Fraktal** refers to fractals, which are mathematical or natural repeating patterns.
