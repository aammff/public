RÃ³Å¼nice w frazach map

The phrases **"Mapa do psucia map"** and **"A map for spoiling maps"** suggest similar ideas but have some key differences in language and meaning.

1. **"Mapa do psucia map"**  
   - This phrase mixes Polish ("Mapa do psucia") with English ("map").  
   - In Polish, "Mapa do psucia" roughly translates to "a map for breaking" or "a map for spoiling."  
   - The phrase as a whole seems awkward because of the language mix. A fully Polish version would be **"Mapa do psucia map"** (still awkward) or **"Mapa do psucia mapy"** (more natural), meaning "a map for spoiling other maps."

2. **"A map for spoiling maps"**  
   - This is a fully English phrase.  
   - It clearly suggests that the map in question is designed to ruin or distort other maps.  
   - The wording makes sense grammatically.

### Key Differences:
- **Language mix**: The first phrase combines Polish and English, while the second is entirely in English.
- **Grammar**: The first phrase is awkward due to the structure, while the second is more natural.
- **Meaning clarity**: The second phrase clearly conveys the idea, while the first may sound strange to native speakers of either language.
