Difference Between Spider Mushroom

"Spider" and "mushroom" are two completely different things:  

- **Spider** 🕷️: An arachnid with eight legs, typically found in various habitats. Spiders spin webs (in most cases) to catch prey and are predators that feed on insects. They belong to the class *Arachnida*.  

- **Mushroom** 🍄: A type of fungus that grows in damp or decaying organic matter. Mushrooms come in various shapes and sizes, with some being edible (like button mushrooms) and others toxic (like Amanita). They belong to the kingdom *Fungi*.
