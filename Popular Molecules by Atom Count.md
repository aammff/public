Popular Molecules by Atom Count

Here are some of the most popular chemical molecules sorted by atom count in ascending order:

1. **Water (H₂O)** → 3 atoms  
2. **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)** → 3 atoms  
3. **Ammonia (NH₃)** → 4 atoms  
4. **Methane (CH₄)** → 5 atoms  
5. **Ozone (O₃)** → 3 atoms  
6. **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)** → 2 atoms  
7. **Ethanol (C₂H₆O)** → 9 atoms  
8. **Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)** → 24 atoms  
9. **Sucrose (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁)** → 45 atoms  
10. **DNA Nucleotide (varies, ~30-40 atoms per unit)**  
11. **Hemoglobin (~10,000+ atoms per molecule)**  

Would you like me to refine this list further or focus on a specific type of molecule?
