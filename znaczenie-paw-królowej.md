1. **Correct meanings of "paw królowej":**  
   - **The Queen's Peacock:** This could refer to an actual peacock owned by a queen, symbolizing majesty, beauty, or regality. It could also appear in poetry, art, or storytelling to symbolize something opulent or grand related to a queen.
   - **A decorative motif:** In some cases, "paw królowej" could refer to a stylized design or artistic representation, inspired by peacock feathers in royal settings.

2. **Incorrect or figurative meanings of "paw królowej":**

   - **Misunderstood metaphor:** Someone might interpret the phrase incorrectly, such as assuming it has a specific historical or idiomatic significance when it does not.
