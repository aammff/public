Is it possible for human to solve three Rubik's cubes simultaneously while juggling?


Yes, it is possible for a human to solve three Rubik's cubes simultaneously while juggling, though it is an exceptionally rare and complex feat requiring extraordinary skill in both juggling and cube-solving. 

This task involves:

1. **Advanced Juggling Skills**: The person must master three-ball juggling and maintain steady control, allowing for consistent timing and rhythm.

2. **Speedcubing Ability**: They must be adept at solving Rubik's cubes very quickly, often under 10–20 seconds per cube, while managing limited time with each cube during the juggling cycle.

3. **Multitasking and Focus**: This feat demands intense concentration, as the person must process the state of each cube during the brief moments it is in their hands and plan moves for the next time it comes around.

4. **Practice and Memorization**: They likely memorize advanced algorithms and practice thousands of times to execute the moves efficiently without dropping the cubes or disrupting the juggling pattern.

This incredible challenge has been achieved by a few skilled individuals, such as professional jugglers and speedcubers like **Que Jianyu**, who holds Guinness World Records for solving multiple Rubik’s cubes while juggling.
