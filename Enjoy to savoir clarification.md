please check if enjoy to savoir is as use to mention

Your sentence needs some clarification or rephrasing to convey your intent clearly. It seems like you’re asking whether **"enjoy to savoir"** makes sense or is commonly used. 

- The phrase **"enjoy to savoir"** is not correct in English. "Savoir" is a French word meaning "to know" (as in factual knowledge), and its usage in an English phrase needs context or clarification. 
- If you’re trying to say something in French, **"enjoy"** doesn’t translate directly. You might be looking for **"aimer" (to like/love)** or **"profiter de" (to take advantage of/enjoy).**

Could you provide more context or clarify the intended meaning? I'd be happy to help refine it further!
