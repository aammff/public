please explain differences between "quine" "second-order quine" "higher-order quine"

Quines and Their Types

A **quine** is a program that, when executed, produces its own source code as output. The term originates from philosopher W.V. Quine, who studied self-reference.

### 1. **Quine (First-Order Quine)**
   - A program that prints its own source code exactly.
   - Example in Python:
     ```python
     s = 's = {!r}\nprint(s.format(s))'
     print(s.format(s))
     ```
   - This program prints its own code when run.

### 2. **Second-Order Quine**
   - A program that produces a different program as output, which in turn produces the original program when executed.
   - Instead of directly printing itself, it generates another program that regenerates it.
   - Itâ€™s essentially a quine that works in two steps.

### 3. **Higher-Order Quine**
   - A generalization of the second-order quine.
   - An **N-th order quine** is a program that produces another program, which when executed **N times** ultimately reproduces the original.
   - For example, a **third-order quine** produces a second-order quine, which produces a first-order quine, which finally outputs the original.

### Summary:
| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Quine (First-Order)** | Prints its own source code directly. |
| **Second-Order Quine** | Produces a different program, which when run produces the original. |
| **Higher-Order Quine** | Extends this idea to N-th order, requiring multiple executions to return to the original. |

These concepts relate to recursion, self-replication, and the idea of self-reference in computing.
