Spammy Revenge vs Self-Righteousness

The concepts of "spammy revenge" and "self-righteousness" differ significantly in their nature, intent, and emotional underpinnings. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

---

### **1. Spammy Revenge**
- **Definition**: A behavior or action characterized by repeatedly or excessively targeting someone with messages, content, or interference to retaliate or get back at them.
- **Motivation**: 
  - Driven by anger, frustration, or a desire to annoy, inconvenience, or harm the target as payback for a perceived wrongdoing.
  - The focus is on overwhelming the target, often without much regard for whether the revenge is proportional.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Often petty or disruptive, like sending multiple messages, posting excessive negative reviews, or flooding someone’s inbox.
  - Lacks moral justification; it’s usually about emotional gratification rather than principle.
- **Example**: Bombarding someone’s social media account with mean comments because they criticized you.

### **2. Self-Righteousness**
- **Definition**: A belief or attitude of moral superiority, where a person sees themselves as inherently right, virtuous, or just, often in comparison to others.
- **Motivation**: 
  - Driven by pride, a need to validate one’s moral or ethical stance, or a desire to judge others for perceived failings.
  - It often stems from a sense of being better or more virtuous.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Focuses on morality, ethics, or principles, even when the stance may come across as condescending or hypocritical.
  - May involve preaching or unsolicited advice, assuming a position of moral authority.
- **Example**: Criticizing others harshly for eating meat because you’re a vegetarian and believe your lifestyle is superior.

While both behaviors can be off-putting to others, spammy revenge is more action-based and impulsive, while self-righteousness is more attitude-based and rooted in personal beliefs.
