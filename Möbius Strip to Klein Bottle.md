please check if Möbius strip/band/loop is to Klein bottle as circle to sphere

Yes, the relationship between a Möbius strip and a Klein bottle is analogous to the relationship between a circle and a sphere, but with some key differences because of the distinct properties of these objects.

### Analogy
1. **Dimensional Context**:
   - The Möbius strip is a **2D surface** embedded in 3D space that has only one side and one edge. 
   - The Klein bottle is a **2D surface** without edges, also embedded in 3D space, but it is a higher-order topological object that cannot be realized without self-intersection in 3D space.

   Similarly:
   - The circle is a **1D curve** embedded in 2D or 3D space.
   - The sphere is a **2D surface** embedded in 3D space.

2. **Construction**:
   - A circle can be thought of as the boundary of a disk (a 2D surface).
   - A Möbius strip is like a "circle with a twist" in the sense that it can be made by taking a rectangle and joining two opposite edges with a half-twist. 
   - A sphere can be thought of as being formed by "filling in" a circle in a symmetric way.
   - A Klein bottle can be thought of as a Möbius strip with its edge "sewn up" in a specific way, making it a closed surface without boundary.

3. **Boundary and Non-Orientability**:
   - A circle is the boundary of a disk, and a Möbius strip has a single boundary (the circle).
   - A sphere has no boundary, and a Klein bottle also has no boundary. However, while the sphere is orientable, the Klein bottle is **non-orientable**, like the Möbius strip.

### Differences
- **Orientability**: The Klein bottle and Möbius strip are non-orientable, while the circle and sphere are orientable. This breaks the strict analogy since the properties differ fundamentally.
- **Dimensional Generalization**: The circle and sphere are part of a progression of orientable surfaces (circle -> sphere -> hypersphere, etc.), while the Möbius strip and Klein bottle belong to the family of non-orientable surfaces.

In conclusion, while there is a conceptual analogy between these pairs, the Möbius strip and Klein bottle are defined in a different topological framework (non-orientable surfaces), making the relationship more nuanced.
