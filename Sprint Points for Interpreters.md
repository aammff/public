Sprint Points for Interpreters

Approximating sprint points depends on factors like team experience, complexity, and available libraries. I'll assume a scale where:  
- **1-3 points** = Simple, well-supported task  
- **5-8 points** = Medium complexity, requires research  
- **10+ points** = Hard, novel, or recursive challenges  

### **Estimates:**  
1️⃣ **Haskell interpreter in Prolog** → **8-13 points**  
   - Parsing Haskell syntax is complex.  
   - Prolog is good for tree-based evaluation but lacks performance.  
   - Type inference (if needed) makes it harder.  

2️⃣ **Prolog interpreter in Haskell** → **5-10 points**  
   - Haskell’s strong typing helps structure Prolog’s unification.  
   - Challenge: Implementing Prolog’s search & backtracking.  
   - Existing work may provide guidance.  

3️⃣ **Forth interpreter in Lisp** → **5-8 points**  
   - Forth is stack-based, Lisp can handle dynamic structures well.  
   - Managing return stack, dictionary, and execution flow is non-trivial.  
   - Could leverage macros for meta-programming.  

4️⃣ **Lisp interpreter in Forth** → **10-15 points**  
   - Forth lacks native GC, memory management is a challenge.  
   - Implementing dynamic typing and garbage collection is tough.  
   - Recursion support requires a workaround.  

Would you like more details on any of these?
