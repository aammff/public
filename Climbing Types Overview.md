please explain differences between bouldering, free/sport, multi-pitch, ice climbing

[Climbing Types Overview]

Climbing can take various forms, each with its own techniques, goals, and gear requirements. Here's a breakdown of the key differences between **bouldering**, **free/sport climbing**, **multi-pitch climbing**, and **ice climbing**:

---

### **1. Bouldering**
- **Overview**: Bouldering is a type of climbing done on small rock formations or artificial walls, typically without ropes.
- **Height**: Climbing heights are usually limited to about 10–20 feet (3–6 meters).
- **Protection**: Climbers use crash pads to cushion falls.
- **Technique**: Focused on short, intense problems (routes) that demand technical skill, strength, and creativity.
- **Environment**: Often done indoors at climbing gyms or on outdoor boulders.
- **Gear**: Minimal—climbing shoes, chalk, and crash pads.

### **2. Free/Sport Climbing**
- **Overview**: 
  - **Free climbing** involves climbing using hands and feet to ascend, with ropes and gear used only for protection (not to aid the climb).
  - **Sport climbing** is a subset of free climbing where the climber ascends routes with pre-installed bolts for protection.
- **Height**: Typically 15–30 meters (50–100 feet) per route for sport climbing.
- **Protection**:
  - Free climbing may involve various types of gear, including cams and nuts, depending on the route.
  - Sport climbing relies on fixed anchors and bolts.
- **Technique**: Requires both endurance and technique to complete routes, which can vary from easy to highly technical.
- **Environment**: Both indoor gyms and outdoor crags.
- **Gear**: Climbing shoes, chalk, rope, harness, belay device, quickdraws (for sport climbing).

### **3. Multi-Pitch Climbing**
- **Overview**: Multi-pitch climbing consists of routes that are too long to be climbed in a single go, so climbers divide them into multiple sections (pitches).
- **Height**: Can range from 100 meters to several hundred meters, depending on the route.
- **Protection**: Similar to sport or traditional climbing, with bolts, cams, and nuts used for protection.
- **Technique**: Requires advanced climbing skills, rope management, and teamwork between the leader and belayer.
- **Environment**: Almost exclusively outdoors on large rock faces (e.g., cliffs, mountains).
- **Gear**: Extensive gear, including ropes, harnesses, cams, nuts, quickdraws, helmets, and sometimes a belay station setup.

### **4. Ice Climbing**
- **Overview**: Ice climbing involves ascending frozen waterfalls, ice-covered rocks, or other icy terrains.
- **Height**: Varies widely, depending on the climb.
- **Protection**: Climbers use ice screws and other gear designed for icy surfaces.
- **Technique**: Requires mastery of using ice tools (ice axes) and crampons to grip and ascend ice surfaces.
- **Environment**: Outdoors in cold climates; often remote and extreme.
- **Gear**: Specialized gear, including ice axes, crampons, insulated climbing boots, ice screws, helmets, and cold-weather clothing.
