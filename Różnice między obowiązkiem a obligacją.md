please explain differences between "obowiązek" "obligacja"

Both **"obowiązek"** and **"obligacja"** come from the same Latin root related to obligation, but they have different meanings in Polish.  

1. **Obowiązek** – refers to a **duty, responsibility, or obligation** that a person is expected or required to fulfill.  
   - Example: *Masz obowiązek płacić podatki.* (You have a duty to pay taxes.)  
   - Used in legal, moral, social, or professional contexts.  

2. **Obligacja** – refers to a **bond (financial instrument)** issued by a government or company as a form of debt.  
   - Example: *Kupiłem obligacje skarbowe.* (I bought government bonds.)  
   - Used in finance and economics, representing an investment or debt security.  

So, **"obowiązek"** is about responsibilities, while **"obligacja"** is about financial bonds.
