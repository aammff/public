how often one should expect negative ping times as measured by ping and mtr?


Negative ping times in tools like `ping` or `mtr` (My Traceroute) are unexpected and generally indicate measurement or reporting anomalies rather than a genuine property of the network. Here's an explanation:

### Causes of Negative Ping Times
1. **Clock Synchronization Issues**:
   - The timestamps used to calculate round-trip time (RTT) are typically based on the local system clock.
   - If the clock is not synchronized correctly (e.g., due to system time adjustments or bugs in timekeeping), it can result in negative time calculations.

2. **Measurement Artefacts**:
   - Some network measurement tools or devices in the path might introduce jitter or incorrect timestamps.
   - Hardware, firmware, or driver bugs in network interface cards (NICs) could cause such anomalies.

3. **Multi-threaded or Multi-core Timing Glitches**:
   - In multi-threaded systems, timing discrepancies can occur if different cores or threads report timestamps slightly out of sync.

4. **Interference from Time Adjustments**:
   - If the system is running a time-synchronization service like NTP (Network Time Protocol), periodic adjustments might temporarily shift the system clock in a way that affects ping timing.

5. **Software Bugs**:
   - Bugs in the `ping` or `mtr` implementation or in the underlying networking stack could produce negative results.

### Frequency of Occurrence
- Negative ping times should be **rare** and generally suggest an issue with the system or software environment, not the network itself.
- If you're seeing frequent negative times, it likely indicates a persistent issue with system timekeeping or the tools being used.

### What to Do If You See Negative Ping Times
1. **Check System Clock**:
   - Verify that your system clock is synchronized correctly, e.g., using `ntpstat` or other time-sync tools.

2. **Update Software**:
   - Ensure that `ping`, `mtr`, and your operating system are updated to their latest versions to avoid bugs.

3. **Monitor Over Time**:
   - If the issue persists, log results over time to identify patterns (e.g., after time adjustments).

4. **Test on Another Machine**:
   - Run the same tests from another system to confirm whether the problem is specific to the original machine.

Negative ping times are not an expected or useful outcome. If they occur frequently, investigating your system's timing mechanisms and ensuring software reliability are critical steps to resolving the issue.
