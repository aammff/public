please prove using lean that 2^0=1


To prove \( 2^0 = 1 \) using the Lean theorem prover, we rely on the properties of exponents, which are typically defined in terms of natural numbers and extended recursively or inductively. Lean has a library of mathematical facts (e.g., in `mathlib`) that includes such foundational results. Here's how you can structure the proof:

### 1. Install Lean and mathlib
Make sure you have Lean and its supporting mathematical library (`mathlib`) installed. You can find instructions in the official documentation: [Lean Prover Documentation](https://leanprover.github.io/).

### 2. Create the proof
Hereâ€™s the code to prove \( 2^0 = 1 \):

```lean
import data.nat.pow -- Import the library for natural number powers

example : 2^0 = 1 :=
nat.pow_zero 2
```

### Explanation:
- `data.nat.pow`: This imports the library that defines the `^` operator for natural number exponents.
- `nat.pow_zero`: This lemma in `mathlib` states that for any natural number \( a \), \( a^0 = 1 \).
- `example : 2^0 = 1` declares a specific instance of the general lemma with \( a = 2 \).

### Steps to Check in Lean
1. Open a Lean file (`.lean`) in an editor that supports Lean (e.g., VSCode with Lean extension).
2. Write or paste the code.
3. Save the file and check the output in the Lean Infoview panel.

If everything is set up correctly, Lean will verify that \( 2^0 = 1 \).
