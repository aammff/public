Polish phrases involving dogs and cats explained

The phrases you provided are in Polish, and they involve different combinations of the words "pies" (dog), "kot" (cat), "ogon" (tail), "macha" (wags), and "pogrzebany" (buried). Here's a breakdown of the differences between them:

1. **"Pies macha ogonem"**  
   - Translation: "The dog wags its tail."  
   - Meaning: This is a straightforward sentence describing a dog wagging its tail.

2. **"Ogon macha psem"**  
   - Translation: "The tail wags the dog."  
   - Meaning: This is a nonsensical or metaphorical phrase, as tails don't wag dogs. It could be used humorously or to describe a situation where something minor controls something major (similar to the English idiom "the tail wagging the dog").

3. **"Pies pogrzebany"**  
   - Translation: "The dog is buried."  
   - Meaning: This phrase describes a dog that has been buried, possibly implying the dog has died.

4. **"Kot pogrzebany"**  
   - Translation: "The cat is buried."  
   - Meaning: Similar to the previous phrase, this describes a cat that has been buried, likely implying the cat has died.

5. **"Ogon macha kotem"**  
   - Translation: "The tail wags the cat."  
   - Meaning: Like "ogon macha psem," this is nonsensical or metaphorical, as tails don't wag cats. It could be used humorously or to describe an absurd situation.

6. **"Kot macha ogonem"**  
   - Translation: "The cat wags its tail."  
   - Meaning: This is a straightforward sentence describing a cat wagging its tail. Cats often wag their tails when they are agitated or focused, unlike dogs, which wag their tails when happy.

### Key Differences:
- **Subject and Action**: The phrases differ in the subject (dog, cat, or tail) and the action (wagging or being buried).
- **Literal vs. Metaphorical**: Some phrases are literal descriptions (e.g., "pies macha ogonem"), while others are nonsensical or metaphorical (e.g., "ogon macha psem").
- **Context**: The phrases involving "pogrzebany" (buried) imply a somber or final context, while the others are more neutral or playful.
