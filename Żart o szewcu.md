please explain the joke "co to sÄ… pieniÄ…dze? szewc bez butÃ³w chodzi"

Å»art o szewcu

The joke **"Co to sÄ… pieniÄ…dze? Szewc bez butÃ³w chodzi."** is a play on words based on the well-known Polish proverb **"Szewc bez butÃ³w chodzi"**, which translates to **"A shoemaker goes without shoes."**  

### **Explanation:**
The original proverb means that professionals often lack the very thing they provide to others. For example, a doctor might neglect their own health, or a mechanic might drive a broken car.  

In this joke, the question **"Co to sÄ… pieniÄ…dze?"** ("What is money?") is humorously "answered" with the proverb. The punchline suggests that **money is something that, just like the shoemaker's shoes, is often missing where it should be.**  

### **Why is it funny?**
1. **Unexpected answer** â€“ The listener expects a definition of money but gets a completely unrelated proverb, making it absurd.  
2. **Implied meaning** â€“ It hints at financial struggles, suggesting that money is something people are supposed to have but often don't.  
3. **Wordplay** â€“ It plays on the common idea that money is always missing where itâ€™s needed most, just like the shoemaker lacking shoes.  

It's a clever way to say, **"Money? Oh, that's just something people don't have when they need it!"** ðŸ˜„
