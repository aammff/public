Mapa do Psucia wyjaśnienie

The **"Mapa do Psucia"** (which translates to "Map of Breaking" in English) is a Polish term referring to a concept map that illustrates how systems, processes, or organizations degrade or become dysfunctional over time. 

It is often used in **business, management, and organizational development** to visualize inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and factors that contribute to failure or decline. The idea is to map out problems systematically to identify **root causes** and areas for improvement. 

The concept is particularly useful in **agile development, software engineering, and operational management**, where it helps teams understand how small issues can accumulate and lead to major breakdowns.
