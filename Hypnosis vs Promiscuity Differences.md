Hypnosis vs Promiscuity Differences

"**Hypnosis**" and "**promiscuity**" are entirely different concepts:  

1. **Hypnosis** – A psychological state of focused attention, relaxation, and increased suggestibility. It is often used for therapeutic purposes, such as reducing stress or breaking bad habits.  

2. **Promiscuity** – A behavioral term referring to engaging in multiple sexual relationships or encounters without long-term commitment. It is often used in discussions about personal relationships, societal norms, and morality.  

In short, hypnosis is related to the mind and suggestibility, while promiscuity is about behavior in relationships and sexuality. They are unrelated in meaning.
