Pi Calculus Deadly Sins

It looks like you’re referring to potential pitfalls or common mistakes in *π-calculus* (pi calculus), often called the "deadly sins" in formal modeling. In process calculi, including π-calculus, these mistakes can lead to incorrect, inefficient, or misleading models of concurrent systems. Some common "deadly sins" in π-calculus include:

### 1. **Name Capture (Variable Capture)**
   - **Mistake:** Accidentally reusing a bound name (channel) in a way that alters its intended meaning.
   - **Example:** If a process binds a name and unintentionally reuses it in a conflicting scope, it may disrupt communication.

### 2. **Free Name Clash**
   - **Mistake:** Using the same name in different contexts without proper scoping.
   - **Example:** If two processes assume the same channel name refers to different things, unexpected behavior can occur.

### 3. **Misuse of Restriction (Scope Extrusion Errors)**
   - **Mistake:** Allowing private channels (created using `νx.P`) to unintentionally escape their intended scope.
   - **Example:** If a private name is leaked incorrectly, it may lead to unintended communications.

### 4. **Incorrect Synchronization**
   - **Mistake:** Assuming communication happens in a particular order when, in fact, π-calculus allows nondeterminism.
   - **Example:** Writing two processes that expect a strict sequence of message-passing but forgetting that order may not be guaranteed.

### 5. **Deadlocks**
   - **Mistake:** Creating a system where two or more processes are stuck waiting for each other indefinitely.
   - **Example:** Two processes each waiting for a message on a channel the other hasn't sent yet.

### 6. **Non-Termination (Divergence)**
   - **Mistake:** A system that enters an infinite loop of communication without making progress.
   - **Example:** A recursive process that never reaches a terminating condition.

### 7. **Race Conditions**
   - **Mistake:** Two processes attempting to interact in a way that depends on unpredictable timing.
   - **Example:** If two processes send messages to the same channel and the receiver isn't designed to handle out-of-order messages, unintended behaviors can arise.

Would you like examples in formal π-calculus notation for any of these?
