Proceduralna generacja postaci

"Proceduralnie generowany ktoś inny" translates from Polish to "procedurally generated someone else" in English. This phrase typically refers to a concept in video game development and computer graphics where characters, environments, or objects are created algorithmically rather than being manually designed by artists. 

In this context, "someone else" suggests that the generated character or entity is not a specific individual but rather a unique creation generated through a set of rules or algorithms. This technique is often used in games to create diverse and varied experiences, allowing for many unique characters or elements without the need for extensive manual design work.
