please explain the following joke: "kto to jest osoba bezdomna? osoba bez stałego adresu ipv6"


The joke is a play on the double meaning of "bez stałego adresu," which in Polish means "without a permanent address." The phrase usually refers to a homeless person, as they lack a stable home address. However, in the joke, it is humorously reinterpreted to mean someone "without a permanent IPv6 address," referencing the technical concept of an IP address in networking.

An IPv6 address is a unique identifier assigned to devices on the internet. So the joke compares a homeless person (who lacks a fixed home address) to someone without a stable IPv6 address (a technical "home" for devices).

It's funny because it mixes the real-world concept of homelessness with a geeky, tech-specific joke about IP addresses, creating a quirky and unexpected punchline.
