please explain differences between "hollow mask illusion" "reversible garment"

Hollow Mask vs Reversible Garment

The **Hollow Mask Illusion** and **Reversible Garment** are two different concepts, one related to visual perception and the other to fashion design. Here's how they differ:

### **Hollow Mask Illusion**
- A **visual illusion** where a concave (hollow) mask of a face appears as a normal convex face.
- This occurs due to **top-down processing** in the brain, which expects faces to be convex because that is how we typically see them in real life.
- The illusion is strong because of **lighting, shading, and depth cues**, which trick the brain into misinterpreting the concave shape as convex.
- It is often used in **neuroscience and psychology** to study perception and even schizophrenia (since some patients do not experience the illusion).

### **Reversible Garment**
- A **fashion design concept** where a single piece of clothing can be worn in multiple ways.
- It can involve **reversible fabrics**, **double-layered designs**, or **convertible features** that allow the garment to be flipped inside out or transformed.
- These garments are often created for **versatility, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness**, allowing wearers to get multiple looks from a single piece.
- Unlike the Hollow Mask Illusion, this is a **physical design feature**, not a perceptual trick.

### **Key Differences**
| Feature            | Hollow Mask Illusion | Reversible Garment |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Category**       | Optical illusion (Psychology) | Fashion design |
| **Concept**       | Brain misinterprets depth cues | Clothing designed for multiple uses |
| **Cause**         | Visual perception and top-down processing | Textile and structural design |
| **Purpose**       | Studying vision and cognition | Versatility in fashion |
| **Example**       | Rotating hollow face mask illusion | A jacket that can be worn inside out for a different look |
