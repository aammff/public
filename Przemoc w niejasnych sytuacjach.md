please explain "jak nie wiadomo o co chodzi to chodzi o przemoc"

Przemoc w niejasnych sytuacjach

The phrase **"jak nie wiadomo o co chodzi, to chodzi o przemoc"** roughly translates to **"if you don't know what it's about, it's about violence"** in English. 

This is a play on the original Polish saying: **"jak nie wiadomo o co chodzi, to chodzi o pieniÄ…dze"** (meaning "if you don't know what it's about, it's about money"). The modified version shifts the focus to violence instead of money. 

It suggests that when something is unclear, underlying tensions, power dynamics, or violent motives might be at play. The phrase is often used in social or political contexts to highlight hidden or unspoken aggression in disputes or conflicts. It emphasizes that even if violence isn't overt, it may be the driving force behind a situation.
